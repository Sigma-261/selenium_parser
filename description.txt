<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosed embodiments generally relate to computerized systems and methods for securing data, and more particularly, and without limitation, computerized systems and methods that generate secured block-chain-based ledger structures that facilitate event-based control of tracked assets.</div>
<heading class="style-scope patent-text" id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0004" num="0003">A block-chain is a distributed database incorporating a number of blocks where each block contains data and/or programs and holds a valid “transaction” that is timestamped. As used herein, a “transaction” is typically a discrete operation that makes up, or is a part of, an information processing action. Each block in a block-chain also includes a link to a previous block in the block-chain thus creating a public distributed storage ledger, i.e., a log or an historical record, of transactions. A robust distributed storage ledger structure (such as a block-chain ledger structure) due to its public nature, redundant verification, and resistance to fraudulent activity, offers advantages over existing centralized server systems. Despite its many advantages, conventional distributed storage ledger systems (such as block-chain-based ledger systems) exhibit significant flaws, especially when used to track assets in secure, high-risk, and/or sensitive applications.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0026" num="0025">System <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may be a computing system configured to execute software instructions to perform one or more operations consistent with disclosed embodiments. In one aspect, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may be associated with a business entity <b class="style-scope patent-text">150</b> (e.g., a financial institution) that provides financial accounts, financial services transactions, and investment services one or more users (e.g., customers of the business entity <b class="style-scope patent-text">150</b>). In some aspects, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may be a distributed system that may include computing components distributed across one or more networks, such as network <b class="style-scope patent-text">120</b>, or other networks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0027" num="0026">In one aspect, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may include computing components configured to store, maintain, and generate data and software instructions. For example, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may include one or more servers (e.g., server <b class="style-scope patent-text">142</b>) and tangible, non-transitory memory devices (e.g., data repository <b class="style-scope patent-text">144</b>). Server <b class="style-scope patent-text">142</b> may include one or more computing devices that may be configured to execute software instructions to perform one or more processes consistent with the disclosed embodiments. In one example, server <b class="style-scope patent-text">142</b> may be a computing device that executes software instructions that perform operations that provides information to one or more other components of computing environment <b class="style-scope patent-text">100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, server <b class="style-scope patent-text">142</b> may include a computer (e.g., a personal computer, network computer, or mainframe computer) having one or more processors that may be selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program. In one aspect, server <b class="style-scope patent-text">142</b> (or other computing components of system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b>) may be configured to provide one or more websites, digital portals, etc., that provide services consistent with business entity <b class="style-scope patent-text">150</b>, such as a digital banking or investment portal, and services consistent with disclosed embodiments. For instance, server <b class="style-scope patent-text">142</b> may be configured to provide information associated with a requested web page over communications network <b class="style-scope patent-text">120</b> to client device <b class="style-scope patent-text">104</b>, which may render the received information and present content from the web page on a display device, e.g., a touchscreen display unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0029" num="0028">In other aspects, server <b class="style-scope patent-text">142</b> (or other computing components of system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b>) may be configured to provide information to one or more application programs executed by client device <b class="style-scope patent-text">104</b> (e.g., through a corresponding application programming interface (API)). For example, client device <b class="style-scope patent-text">104</b> may execute an application program associated with and provided by business entity <b class="style-scope patent-text">150</b>, such a mobile banking application and/or a mobile wallet application, to provide services consistent with the disclosed embodiments. In some instances, server <b class="style-scope patent-text">142</b> may provide information to client devices <b class="style-scope patent-text">102</b>, <b class="style-scope patent-text">104</b>, and/or <b class="style-scope patent-text">106</b> (e.g., through the API associated with the executed application program), and client devices <b class="style-scope patent-text">102</b>, <b class="style-scope patent-text">104</b>, and/or <b class="style-scope patent-text">106</b> may be configured by the executed application program to present portions of the information to corresponding users through a corresponding graphical user interface (GUI).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0030" num="0029">In further aspects, server <b class="style-scope patent-text">142</b> (or other computing components of system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b>) may be configured to provide to client devices <b class="style-scope patent-text">102</b>, <b class="style-scope patent-text">104</b>, and/or <b class="style-scope patent-text">106</b> (and/or receive from client device <b class="style-scope patent-text">104</b>) information associated with services provided by business entity <b class="style-scope patent-text">150</b>. For example, client device <b class="style-scope patent-text">104</b> may receive the transmitted information, and store portions of the information in locally accessible storage device and/or network-accessible storage devices and data repositories (e.g., cloud-based storage). In one instance, client device <b class="style-scope patent-text">104</b> may execute stored instructions (e.g., an application program, a web browser, a mobile banking application, and/or a mobile wallet application) to process portions of the stored data and render portions of the stored data for presentation to user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>. Additionally, server <b class="style-scope patent-text">142</b> may be incorporated as a corresponding node in a distributed network, and additionally or alternatively, as a corresponding networked server in a cloud-computing environment. Furthermore, server <b class="style-scope patent-text">142</b> may communicate via network <b class="style-scope patent-text">120</b> with one or more additional servers (not shown), which may facilitate the distribution of processes for parallel execution by the additional servers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0031" num="0030">In further aspects, business entity <b class="style-scope patent-text">150</b> may represent a “controlling entity” capable of regulating transactions assets (e.g., units of virtual currency, units of various financial instruments, physical assets, etc.) tracked within hybrid public-private ledgers consistent with the disclosed embodiments. By way of example, one or more computing components of system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> (e.g., server <b class="style-scope patent-text">142</b>) may be configured (e.g., by executed software instructions) to establish one or more rules that regulate a distributions of and/or transactions associated with the tracked assets, an initiation of transfers of the tracked assets (e.g., a sale, a use of the tracked assets as collateral in a secured transaction etc.), and further, any additional or alternate action involving the tracked assets and/or the hybrid public-private ledger (e.g., processes that generate additional cryptographic key sets for user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>, processes that recover assets tracked in the hybrid public-private ledger, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0032" num="0031">Additionally, in some aspects, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may establish causal relationships between one or more of the established rules and one or more events that trigger an initiation of one or more corresponding regulated distributions, transfers, and/or other actions involving assets tracked within the hybrid public-private ledger (e.g., “triggering events”). For example, a confirmed loss of a private cryptographic key issued to user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b> may represent a triggering event that causes system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> to verify user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>'s identity, initiate a transaction of the orphaned assets, generate a new pair of public and private cryptographic keys for user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b> (i.e., public and private block-chain keys), and transmit at least the private block-chain key to user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b> through secure, non-accessible processes, in accordance with one or more of the established rules.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0033" num="0032">Further, by way of example, a theft of a portion of user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>'s tracked assets (e.g., units of virtual currency specified within one of more blocks of the hybrid public-private ledger) may represent a triggering event that causes system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> to initiate a recovery protocol to generate a transaction request to recover the value of the stolen assets (e.g., to transfer the stolen assets back to user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>), and further, to generate a new pair of public and private block-chain keys for user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>, as described above. In other instances, a death and/or incapacitation of user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b> may represent a triggering event that causes system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> to initiate a series of transaction to distribute of at least a portion of the tracked assets (e.g., through corresponding transaction requests consistent with the disclosed embodiments) to one or more additional owners identified by user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b> and specified within corresponding ones of the identified rules.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0034" num="0033">In some aspects, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may be configured to establish one or more of the rules, and further, one or more of the causal relationships and triggering events, based on internal regulations associated with business entity <b class="style-scope patent-text">150</b>. For example, the one or more internal regulations associated with business entity <b class="style-scope patent-text">150</b> may specify that system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> verify an identity of user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b> (e.g., based on various forms of multi-factor authentication data) and/or obtain specific elements of documentation (e.g., a police report, etc.) prior to initiating the lost private key protocol and/or the recovery protocols outlined above. In other aspects, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may one or more of the rules and/or triggering events based on information received from user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b> (e.g., as input provided to a web page or other graphical user interface (GUI) presented by client device <b class="style-scope patent-text">104</b> and provided to system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b>). For example, user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b> may specify, as input to the web page or GUI presented by client device <b class="style-scope patent-text">104</b>, one or more individuals that would receive portions of the tracked assets upon completion of one or more tasks and/or in the event of user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>'s accidental death. The disclosed embodiments are, however, not limited to the exemplary triggering events and established rules described above, and in further aspects, the disclosed embodiments may be configured to generate any additional or alternate user- and system-specified rules and triggering events consistent with the hybrid public-private ledger and appropriate to the tracked assets, user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>, and/or business entity <b class="style-scope patent-text">150</b> (i.e., acting as a centralized authority for the hybrid public-private ledger).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0035" num="0034">Further, and as outlined below, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may be configured to store the one or more established rules (e.g., as a rules engine) and one or more of the established trigger events (e.g., as an event trigger list) within a portion of a local data repository (e.g., data repository <b class="style-scope patent-text">144</b>). Additionally or alternatively, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may be configured to store portions of the rules engine and/or event trigger list within a secure data repository accessible to system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> across network <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> (e.g., cloud-based storage).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0036" num="0035">As described above, one or more computing components of system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> (e.g., server <b class="style-scope patent-text">142</b>) may be configured to generate pairs of public and private block-chain keys for user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b> (e.g., user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>'s public/private block-chain key pair), and to provide the generated private block-chain key to user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b> through secure, non-accessible and/or out-of-band communications (e.g., by mail, etc.). In further embodiments, the one or more components of system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> (e.g., server <b class="style-scope patent-text">142</b>) may be configured to generate and maintain additional cryptographic keys that facilitate a generation and maintenance of portions of the hybrid public-private ledger. For instance, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may be configured to generate a master key, which system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may leverage to encrypt the stored rules engine.

For example, as described in reference to <figref class="style-scope patent-text" idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a user (e.g., user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>) may be associated with a device (e.g., client device <b class="style-scope patent-text">104</b>) that executes a stored software application (e.g., a wallet application) capable of obtaining a current version of a conventional block-chain ledger from one or more networked computer systems (e.g., one of peer systems <b class="style-scope patent-text">160</b> configured to “mine” broadcasted transaction data and update ledgers). In some aspects, the current version of a conventional block-chain ledger may represent a “longest” block-chain ledger than includes a maximum number of discrete “blocks,” which may identify transactions that transfer, distribute, etc., portions of tracked assets among various owners, including user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, client device <b class="style-scope patent-text">104</b> may obtain the current block-chain ledger, and may process the block chain ledger to determine that a prior owner (e.g., user <b class="style-scope patent-text">108</b>) transferred ownership of a portion of the tracked assets to user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b> in a corresponding transaction (e.g., transaction <b class="style-scope patent-text">202</b>, schematically illustrated in <figref class="style-scope patent-text" idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). As described above, one or more of peer systems <b class="style-scope patent-text">160</b> may have previously data verified, processed, and packed associated with transaction <b class="style-scope patent-text">202</b> may be into a corresponding block of the conventional block-chain using any of the exemplary techniques described above and/or apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0056" num="0055">In some aspects, as illustrated in <figref class="style-scope patent-text" idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, transaction <b class="style-scope patent-text">202</b> may include input data that references one or more prior transactions (e.g., transactions that transferred ownership of the tracked asset portion to user <b class="style-scope patent-text">108</b>), and further, output data that includes instructions for transferring the tracked asset portion to one or more additional owners (e.g., user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>). For example, input data consistent with the disclosed embodiments may include, but is not limited to, a cryptographic hash of the one or more prior transactions (e.g., hash <b class="style-scope patent-text">202</b>A) and the set of rules and triggers associated with the assets while the output data consistent with the disclosed embodiments may include, but is not limited to, a quantity or number of units of the tracked asset portion that are subject to transfer in transaction <b class="style-scope patent-text">202</b> and a public key of the recipient (e.g., public key <b class="style-scope patent-text">202</b>B of user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0059" num="0058">For example, data specifying transaction <b class="style-scope patent-text">204</b> may include, but is not limited to, a cryptographic hash <b class="style-scope patent-text">204</b>A of prior transaction <b class="style-scope patent-text">202</b>, a quantity or number of units of the tracked asset portion that are subject to transfer in transaction <b class="style-scope patent-text">204</b>, and a public key of the recipient (e.g., public key <b class="style-scope patent-text">204</b>B of user <b class="style-scope patent-text">112</b>).

Further, and by way of example, the presence of user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>'s public key <b class="style-scope patent-text">202</b>B within transaction data included within the conventional block-chain ledger may enable various devices and systems (e.g., client devices <b class="style-scope patent-text">106</b>, <b class="style-scope patent-text">106</b>, and/or <b class="style-scope patent-text">108</b>, peer systems <b class="style-scope patent-text">160</b>, etc.) to verify user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>'s digital signature <b class="style-scope patent-text">204</b>C, as applied to data specifying transaction <b class="style-scope patent-text">204</b>.</div>

In certain instances, peer systems <b class="style-scope patent-text">160</b> may act as “miners” for the block-chain ledger, and may competitively process the received transaction data (either alone or in conjunction with other data) to generate additional blocks of the ledger, which may be appended to the block-chain ledger and distributed across peer systems <b class="style-scope patent-text">160</b> (e.g., through a peer-to-peer network) and to other connected devices of environment <b class="style-scope patent-text">100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0061" num="0060">In some aspects, conventional block-chain ledger architectures described above may enable the public to review content of the ledgers and verify ownerships. Further, the decentralized nature of conventional block-chain ledgers may also enable multiple distributed networks to verify the contents of a single ledger. The resulting redundancy may render conventional block-chain ledger architecture more robust than centralized server systems, and effectively eliminate the falsification of ledger data by malicious parties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0062" num="0061">Despite these advantages, conventional block-chain ledger architectures may exhibit significant flaws when implemented by secured, high-risk systems. By way of example, unencrypted conventional ledger blocks may represent a security concern for transactions of sensitive nature, and further, may represent a privacy concern for members of the general public. For instance, information indicative of an interaction of a prior asset owner and a corresponding device, as present within conventional block-chain ledgers, may represent private information that should not be available to future owners, let alone members of the public.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0063" num="0062">Further, if an owner were to lose or misplace a corresponding private key, the distributed nature of conventional block-chain ledger architectures, such as those described above, provide little recourse to recover possession of the one or more tracked assets. In certain aspects, the rigidity and inflexibility of these conventional block-chain ledger architectures, and their inability to adapt to changing circumstances (e.g., loss of private keys, theft of tracked assets due to fraudulent or malicious activity), often results in volatility in the usage of the tracked assets and an erosion in a public trust of conventional block-chain ledgers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0064" num="0063">Thus, there is a need for improved systems and methods that not only enhance the security of block-chain ledger architectures for use high-risk, sensitive applications, but that also provide a framework that provides owners or holders of assets tracked by block-chain ledger architectures with recourse in an event of fraud or malicious activity, while maintaining the public availability and verification characteristic of block-chain ledgers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0065" num="0064">b. Exemplary Hybrid Public-Private Block-Chain Ledger Architectures</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0066" num="0065">The disclosed embodiments address these and other problems associated with conventional block-ledger architectures in a technical manner, by providing computer-implemented systems and methods that augment a conventional block-chain ledger with a private-master encryption key architecture that, in conjunction with an owner's pair of public and private block-chain keys, selectively encrypt ledger data to protect both a privacy of owners of tracked assets and a confidentiality of existing instruction sets maintained within the block-chain ledger.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0067" num="0066">Further, by incorporating an encrypted rules engine and corresponding list of triggering events (e.g., an event triggers list) into each block of the conventional block-chain ledger architecture (and thus generating a hybrid, public-private block-chain architecture), computer-implemented systems and methods consistent with the disclosed embodiments may perform operations that provide owners or holders tracked assets with recovery options in an event of fraud or malicious activity, while maintaining the public availability and verification characteristic of conventional block-chain ledgers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0068" num="0067">In certain aspects, discrete data blocks of the conventional block-chain ledgers (e.g., as outlined above in reference to <figref class="style-scope patent-text" idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and of the hybrid block-chain ledgers (e.g., as described in reference to <figref class="style-scope patent-text" idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) may include common elements of data that may specify transactions that distribute, transfer, and/or otherwise act upon portions of tracked assets. For example, these common data elements may include, but are not limited to, input data that references one or more prior transactions (e.g., a cryptographic hash of the one or more prior transactions), output data that includes instructions for transferring the tracked asset portion to one or more additional owners (e.g., a quantity or number of units of the tracked asset portion that are subject to the transaction and a public key of the recipient) and further, a digital signature applied to the input and/or output data using a corresponding public key of a current owner of the tracked asset portion. The disclosed embodiments are, however, not limited to exemplary transactions that include a transfer of tracked assets and to the exemplary data elements described above, and in further embodiments, discrete blocks of the hybrid block-chain ledgers may represent any additional or alternate transaction appropriate to the tracked assets, and further, any additional or alternate data appropriate to the tracked assets and to the transaction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0069" num="0068">In contrast to the conventional block-chain ledgers described above, the disclosed embodiments may establish a “centralized authority” which controls the rules engine and the trigger list. The centralized authority establishes and maintains rules (e.g., through the rules engine and corresponding list of triggering events) that facilitate regulatory-based, policy-based, and customer-specified controls of transactions involving the tracked assets (e.g., units of virtual currency, etc.). The triggering event list and the rules engine vets all transactions. The centralized authority controls the rules engine, and the trigger list, while the user is able to review and possibly modify the trigger list using their own private key.</div>

In some aspects, the generated and stored rules engine may identify or more rules that regulate a distribution of the tracked assets, an initiation of one or more transactions involving the tracked assets (e.g., a sale, a use of the tracked assets as collateral in a secured transaction etc.), and further, any additional or alternate action involving the tracked assets and/or the hybrid public-private ledger (e.g., processes that generate additional cryptographic key sets for user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>, processes that recover assets racked in the hybrid public-private ledger, etc.). Further, and as described above, the generated and stored list of triggering events may include information that specifies causal relationships between one or more of the established rules and one or more events that trigger an initiation of one or more corresponding regulated distributions, transactions, and/or actions associated with assets tracked within the hybrid public-private ledger (e.g., the triggering events).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0072" num="0071">In further contrast to the conventional block-chain ledgers described above, one or more computing components of system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> (e.g., server <b class="style-scope patent-text">142</b> upon execution of stored instructions) may generate additional cryptographic keys that facilitate the exemplary regulation of transactions (e.g., distributions, transfers, and/or actions) involving assets tracked within the hybrid public-private ledger. By way of example, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may generate a master cryptographic key with which system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may encrypt the generated and stored rules engine.

For example, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may perform operations that hash the encrypted rules engine and list of triggering events into a genesis block of the hybrid block-chain ledger, the contents of which may be incorporated (e.g., by client devices <b class="style-scope patent-text">102</b>, <b class="style-scope patent-text">104</b>, and/or <b class="style-scope patent-text">106</b>, peer systems <b class="style-scope patent-text">160</b>, etc.) into each of the subsequent transaction blocks generated and appended to the hybrid block-chain ledger.

Further, in certain aspects, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may be configured to detect an occurrence of an event (e.g., based on data received from client devices <b class="style-scope patent-text">102</b>, <b class="style-scope patent-text">104</b>, and/or <b class="style-scope patent-text">106</b>, etc.), may determine whether the list of triggering events includes the detected event, and when triggering event list includes the detected event, perform one or more operations consistent with an established rule that references the detected event, as described below in reference to <figref class="style-scope patent-text" idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</div>

In an embodiment, a centralized authority may be assigned to establish regulatory-based, policy-based, and customer-specified control over assets tracked within the hybrid block-chain ledger. In some aspects, tracked assets consistent with the disclosed embodiments may include, but are not limited to, units of a virtual currency or a crypto-currency, units of financial instruments held by one or more owners, and physical assets utilized by one or more individuals and/or entities. In some aspects, a computer system associated with the centralized authority (e.g., system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> associated with business entity <b class="style-scope patent-text">150</b>) may execute one more stored application programs to cause system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> to recover, authorize, audit, and/or verify an ownership of at least a portion of the tracked assets and/or transactions involving he tracked assets based on established and maintained rules.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0093" num="0092">In one aspect, one or more computing components of system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may generate a rules engine and a list of triggering events, which may be stored within a portion of data repository <b class="style-scope patent-text">144</b> (e.g., in step <b class="style-scope patent-text">402</b>). For example, the generated and stored rules engine may identify or more rules that regulate a distribution of the tracked assets, an initiation of one or more transactions involving the tracked assets (e.g., a sale, a use of the tracked assets as collateral in a secured transaction etc.), and further, any additional or alternate action involving the tracked assets and/or the hybrid public-private ledger (e.g., processes that generate additional cryptographic key sets for user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>, processes that recover assets tracked in the hybrid public-private ledger, etc.).

For example, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may perform operations in step <b class="style-scope patent-text">406</b> that hash the encrypted rules engine and list of triggering events into a genesis block of the hybrid block-chain ledger, the contents of which may be incorporated (e.g., by client devices <b class="style-scope patent-text">102</b>, <b class="style-scope patent-text">104</b>, and/or <b class="style-scope patent-text">106</b>, peer systems <b class="style-scope patent-text">160</b>, etc.) into each of the subsequent transaction blocks generated and appended to the hybrid block-chain ledger.

<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0138" num="0137">Further, in some aspects, each of connected devices <b class="style-scope patent-text">402</b> may provide data indicative of usage, care, maintenance, and repayments to a centralized server (e.g., a server of system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b>), which may perform operations that update a creditworthiness of an owner based on the predicted life of connected devices <b class="style-scope patent-text">402</b> and risk exposures (e.g., for purposes of providing insurance) in real time. The disclosed embodiments may, for example, reward good behavior from an individual with rewards of better terms and/or penalize poor behavior, and thus customizing both load and insurance product to the individual.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0139" num="0138">For instance, and consistent with the disclosed embodiments, office equipment and company car of a business owner may represent “connected devices,” and the disclosed embodiments may monitor usage of the connected devices based on embedded sensors and/or a surrounding network of sensors disposed within in the environment. In some aspects, portions of the office equipment may be used infrequently (e.g., as most of the business is off premises), and system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may establish, based on the usage data, that the office equipment experiences a relatively low level of depreciation, while the company car experiences a substantial amount of depreciation. Consistent with the disclosed embodiments, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may assign a “medium” deprecation rating to the collective group of connected devices (e.g., the office equipment and the company car) based on the usage data, and system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may leverage this information when the business owner attempts to collateralize these connected devices, e.g., in support of a loan application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0140" num="0139">b. Ownership Tracking of Connected Devices and Payment</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0141" num="0140">Additionally, conventional block-chain ledgers are often inadequate to track a partial ownership of various assets, as ownership rights and agreements change over the course of time. Moreover, actual cosigners of loans or accounts may experience difficulty in establishing their own individual responsibility in the instances of partially owned assets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0142" num="0141">Hybrid block-chain ledgers consistent with the disclosed embodiments may, in some aspects, provide a shared ledger payment mechanism that, at the time of purchase settlement, assigns ownership to a purchased item by making a connection to the item and embedding the item with an unique owner identifier, timestamp and purchase value. If there were split ownership of the item, the disclosed embodiments may record the multiple owners as a value pair and register corresponding percentages of ownership. The disclosed embodiments may further complete registration of the purchased item within the hybrid block-chain ledger, which tracks the ownership and allows the system and/or devices of devices periodically check-in with the ledger system to maintain a corresponding ownership record.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0143" num="0142">By tracking partial ownership of assets, hybrid block-chain ledgers consistent with the disclosed embodiments may allow for real-time tracking of individual contributions spread over the entire ownership structure. In certain aspects, the real-time tracking provided by the disclosed embodiments may be useful in partial ownership situations with complex disbursement schemes. For example, using any of the exemplary techniques described above, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may perform operations that automatically disburse profits according to the ownership and/or disbursement arrangements and/or create new genesis blocks based on the ownership instructions set forth within event trigger list <b class="style-scope patent-text">322</b> and/or rules engine <b class="style-scope patent-text">324</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0144" num="0143">For instances, a husband and wife may jointly purchase car for $10,000. Upon the completion of payment for the car, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may determine that husband contributed 60% of the cost, and the wife contributed 40% of the cost. In some aspects, rules engine <b class="style-scope patent-text">324</b> may include rules establishing joint ownership on the basis of the proportional contributions of the husband and wife, and in the event of divorce (e.g., a triggering event within event trigger list <b class="style-scope patent-text">322</b>), system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may distribute the ownership in accordance with rules engine <b class="style-scope patent-text">324</b>. The disclosed embodiments are, however, not limited to property settlements subsequent to divorce, and event trigger list <b class="style-scope patent-text">322</b> and/or rules engine <b class="style-scope patent-text">324</b> may include additional data that supports the disbursement of profits upon sales of items and/or within a partnership.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0145" num="0144">Further, a startup company may exhibit a distributed ownership structure including three co-founders and an investor owner. In certain aspects, rules engine <b class="style-scope patent-text">324</b> may include an existing payment structure rule that specifies a distribution of profits among the co-founders and the investor. When the startup company is acquired or receives funding, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may detect a triggering event, and rules engine <b class="style-scope patent-text">322</b> proceeds to create a new ownership structure, and creating a new genesis block.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0146" num="0145">c. Automated Ownership Transfers</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0147" num="0146">Using conventional block-chain ledger systems, all entries are made sequentially and are generated in a wide range of applications, which can lead to delays in executing the transactions. Many transactions, however, follow a standardize set of rules based on events associated with the owner. In some aspects, the disclosed hybrid block-chain ledgers may facilitate a transfer of ownership of tracked assets in response to an occurrence of a set of standardize events, thus expediting disbursement and ownership transfers, and reducing the need for protracted analysis of the ownership structures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0148" num="0147">The disclosed embodiments may, for example, track an ownership of connected devices based on a unique identifier and periodic checks with a network connection, which may be aggregated with associated data (e.g., value, purchase time, usage duration, geo-location, etc.) to form a connected asset inventory system. If items cannot periodically check into the ownership network, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may prompt the customer will be prompted to reconcile, or a public network may request independent verification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0149" num="0148">The disclosed embodiments may also establish a number of predetermined trigger conditions which, when triggered, execute the sale or disbursement and re-allocation of ownership of items registered with the connected asset inventory system. These predetermined instructions may be stored on a ledger system, and the event and completion of the disbursement may be validated by the pubic “miners” (e.g., pee systems <b class="style-scope patent-text">160</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0150" num="0149">In some aspects, transactions related to ownership of a particular property may be added to the exemplary hybrid block-chain ledgers described above. System <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b>, acting on behalf of the centralized authority (i.e., business entity <b class="style-scope patent-text">150</b>) may generate a genesis block in partnership with a manufacturer/retailer at the time of purchase, and/or appends information from a genesis block created by a manufacturer. System <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may also generate a set of rules for ownership transfer based on input from the individuals involved in the transfer, which may be incorporated into the hybrid block chain ledger as a rules engine (e.g., rules engine <b class="style-scope patent-text">322</b>) using any of the exemplary techniques described above. Public portions of hybrid block-chain ledgers consistent with the disclosed embodiments may verify a current status of ownership, and when a preset event or criteria is reached (e.g., within event trigger list <b class="style-scope patent-text">322</b>), system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> performs operations that initiate a transfer of ownership of the property based on the established rules, and the ownership transfer is updated through the distributed network.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0151" num="0150">For instances, life insurance claims processes may proceed upon a death of a family member and a receipt of an official “certified” death certificate from a governmental entity (e.g., trigger events). The disclosed embodiments may, in some aspects, require that the ledger “miners” of peer systems <b class="style-scope patent-text">160</b> validate the trigger events as well as validate the completion of the “disbursement” or payment event.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0152" num="0151">Further during estate planning, the disclosed embodiments may “tag” or track every asset that uses a network connection to generate and create rules around automatic disbursements. Upon an event trigger/confirmation (e.g., as specified in event trigger list <b class="style-scope patent-text">322</b>), system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> automatically puts into effects the rules created by a customer (e.g., as stored within rules engine <b class="style-scope patent-text">324</b>). The automated transfer of ownership may, in some aspects, reduce the workload of an executor and track all changes made to the event triggers, which allows for greater clarity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0153" num="0152">d. Processes for Tracking Earmarked Distributions</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0154" num="0153">In certain aspects, many electronic funds transfers are earmarked for specific uses and/or for specific purchases of certain types of products (e.g., earmarked donations, child support, welfare, kid's allowance, some government grants, etc.). Using conventional processes, it may be difficult to track and verify that the allotted funds are used strictly on allowed purchases. Furthermore, using conventional processes, an individual that provides funds may rely on reports the individual spending the funds the earmark has been respected, and moreover, the appropriate use of funds may often be taken on faith.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0155" num="0154">The disclosed embodiments may enable a hybrid block-chain ledger to create and enforce rules controlling transfer of earmarked funds, thus providing a systematic mechanism for tracking and controlling spending. For example, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may establish (e.g., in rules engine <b class="style-scope patent-text">322</b>) a set of allowed transaction rules that enforce the set of earmarks for particular funds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0156" num="0155">In some aspects, these systems could be used in international remittance, where funds are sent for specific uses. If the transaction is earmarked for specific items and/or types of items, the established rules may be incorporated into an encrypted event trigger list and/or rules engine (e.g., by system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b>) within the transaction block sending the funds overseas, as described adobe. The recipient of the fund will be able to review the trigger events that facilitate a use of the particular funds, and if they attempt to use the funds in a way that violates the transaction earmarks, the transaction could be refused, and/or the provider of the fund could be notified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0157" num="0156">In some aspects, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may establish rules within the rules engine (e.g., rules engine <b class="style-scope patent-text">324</b>) that allow compliant transactions to proceed, while initiating a set of contingency steps transactions outside of the earmarks. These steps may, but are not limited to, include notification of the originating party, flagging the transaction, denying the transaction to name a few.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0158" num="0157">For example, a customer of business entity <b class="style-scope patent-text">150</b> (e.g., user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>) may intend to send money to his parents to repair their roof in a remote village in China. User <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>'s parents do not have a bank account, so user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b> must send the money through an intermediary (e.g., user <b class="style-scope patent-text">112</b>). User <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b> may worry that user <b class="style-scope patent-text">112</b> may use the funds inappropriately, leading to an unrepaired roof. In some aspects, user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b> may transfer funds using the exemplary hybrid block-chain described above, and may establish (e.g., within event trigger list <b class="style-scope patent-text">322</b> and/or rules engine <b class="style-scope patent-text">324</b>) an earmark for s contractor already selected for the roof repairs. Although user <b class="style-scope patent-text">112</b> believes she can get a better deal by getting the roof repaired by a different contractor, user <b class="style-scope patent-text">112</b> access event trigger list <b class="style-scope patent-text">322</b> (e.g., using user <b class="style-scope patent-text">112</b>'s private crypto key) and determines that the different contractor cannot be paid with user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>'s funds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0159" num="0158">e. Shipping Beacons Based on Connected Devices</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0160" num="0159">The consumer market may be moving towards a model where purchases are made directly from manufacturers. In some instances, as the point of purchase becomes closer and closer to the manufacturers, inherent problems exist in tracking and paying for these goods in an equitable way that protects both the manufacturer and the purchaser. For example, using conventional processes, a cost of a product is paid up-front by a purchaser, who relies on the seller's reputation and ethical behavior to produce and ship the product. As smaller manufacturers enter the market place and purchases are made on a global scale, these conventional payment processes are often unable to account for the realities of modern consumer and manufacturer behavior.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0161" num="0160">Using the disclosed embodiments, the exemplary hybrid block-chain ledgers described above may for a basis for a payment system that tracks the good/product through its shipping route, thus mitigating risks associated with remote purchases, and incentivizing manufacturer to produce and ship their products on schedule. For example, upon the purchase of good from a manufacturer, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may establish a payment and shipment schedule, which may be included within event trigger list <b class="style-scope patent-text">322</b> and/or rules engine <b class="style-scope patent-text">324</b>. Further, upon acceptance of the conditions by the manufacturer, and system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may disburse an initial amount of funds to the manufacturer and create an appropriate genesis/new block using any of the exemplary techniques described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0162" num="0161">A trusted shipping party (e.g., FedEx™, DHL™, etc.) may utilize a private key to sign transactions along one or more stages of shipping of the product, and a partial disbursement of funds may occur at these stages to both the trusted shipping party and the manufacturer. As the shipment crosses set target checkpoints (e.g., International borders, customs, provincial/state boundaries, etc.) further partial disbursement is made as the trust shipping party signs transactions within the hybrid block-chain ledger. When the purchaser signs the receipt of the product into the hybrid block-chain ledger, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may perform operations to make the final disbursement, thus settling all accounts of the shipment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0163" num="0162">For example, a customer of business entity <b class="style-scope patent-text">150</b> (e.g., user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>) may purchase ten barbecues from an overseas manufacturer for use and distribution to friends and family. User <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b> may approach business entity <b class="style-scope patent-text">150</b> and request establishment of a disbursement schedule for the manufacturer based on the exemplary hybrid block-chain ledgers described above. System <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may, in some aspects, create a transaction in the hybrid block-chain ledger that holds user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>'s payment (e.g., an escrow account), and system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may establish rules that sequentially disburse the payment when the item ship, when the items clear customs, when they are in the same town as user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>, and finally when user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b> is able to sign for items after inspection.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0164" num="0163">f. Clearinghouse Models for Contract Settlement</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0165" num="0164">In some instances, “smart contracts” that leverage conventional block-chain ledgers may serve to enforce agreements in a timely and efficient manner creating a permanent record of the transaction with all the enforceable rules associated with the contracts. In further aspects, the use of the exemplary hybrid block-chain ledgers described above allows the terms of these smart contracts to be modified by a centralized authority to accommodate the changing realities of the real world. Problems remain, however, surrounding the reconciliation of disputes and/or the initiation of transactions by the centralized authority to correct problems in the list of transactions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0166" num="0165">In some aspects, the exemplary hybrid block-chain ledgers described above may be further augmented to include a “side” block-chain ledger that tracks any automated transactions initiated either by the rules residing on the hybrid block-chain ledger (e.g., event trigger list <b class="style-scope patent-text">322</b> and/or rules engine <b class="style-scope patent-text">324</b>) or by a centralized authority having power to enact a transaction outside of normal transaction usage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0167" num="0166">When a rule-based or centralized-authority-initiated transaction occurs, the associated supporting documentation and triggering events may be tracked in a special transaction category that requires validation by neutral third party to verify that the transaction is in-line with the set of rules/agreements allowed on those particular smart contracts. These processes allow for reconciliation of assets, funds, and ledger tracked items via a neutral third party. The disclosed embodiments may also allow for parties involved in the transaction to request reviews of transactions in cases of errors or conflicting triggering events, and a neutral third party may act as an arbitrator in the cases where conflict exists.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0168" num="0167">For example, the disclosed embodiments may enable a customer of business entity <b class="style-scope patent-text">150</b> (e.g., user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>) to create, within a hybrid block-chain ledger, a contractor renovating user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>'s house. The smart contract may, in some aspects, specify scheduled disbursements based on mutually agreed-upon inspections of work. In one instance, the contractor presents and inspection report to a corresponding financial institution to receive a scheduled disbursement. Upon receipt of a notification of the disbursement, user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b> requests that system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> recovers the disbursement, and user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b> has not completed the requisite and triggering inspection, and system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> generates non-compliance rules (e.g., within rules engine <b class="style-scope patent-text">324</b> using the master key or within the side block-chain) to recover user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>'s funds. The contractor may, however, argue to the financial institution that the required inspection has occurred and provides a corresponding report (that was not signed off by user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>'s private key). Business entity <b class="style-scope patent-text">150</b> and the contractor's financial institution may initiate an automated arbitration between user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b> and the contractor against the terms of the smart contract. The arbitration finds in favor of user <b class="style-scope patent-text">110</b>, who recovers the funds, and system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> records the arbitration decision into corresponding transaction data for submission to peer systems <b class="style-scope patent-text">160</b>, as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0169" num="0168">g. Document Tracking Using Hybrid Block-Chain Ledgers</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0170" num="0169">In further instances, processes that maintain deeds and other important document are crucial for proper record keeping and accessibility. The disclosed embodiments may be configured to the records are maintained in a secure, accessible repository and available to prove ownership or an occurrence of an event in a case of conflicting documentation. For example, the disclosed embodiments may hash a document into the exemplary hybrid block-chain ledgers described above using a secure, known pixel replacement to add further encryption. The hashed document may also be used in the case of transactions, and an ownership chain may be maintained. Further, using the hybrid block-chain ledgers described above may enable financial institutions and other entities that provide loans secured against any of these deeds to automatically execute liens in the case of default on the loan. Further, the use of secured images may also provide further security, especially in a case of conflicting documentation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0171" num="0170">h. Counterfeit Prevention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0172" num="0171">Processes that prevent an introduction of counterfeit manufactured goods into the marketplace are essential to preserve the intellectual property rights of manufacturers and ensure that criminal activities do not negatively affect legitimate manufacturers. In many instances, however, manufacturers lose track of their goods once they leave their manufacturing plant and move into the hands of shipping partners or distribution partners, leaving the possibility that losses may occur before a customer is able to purchase the product. The disclosed embodiments may provide a mechanism to track a legitimate product through its lifecycle and control and confirm transactions involving the legitimate product, thus reducing an ability of counterfeiters to enter and disrupt the marketplace.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0173" num="0172">For example, the exemplary hybrid block-chain ledgers described above may function as a public repository of products that tracks ownership chains. The exemplary hybrid block-chain ledgers described above may also provide a centralized authority functionality that enables manufacturers to establish rules around transaction (e.g., minimum pricing, authorized dealer location, etc.). The centralized authority functionality may also be shared with a financial institution (e.g., business entity <b class="style-scope patent-text">150</b>) to control financing terms or transaction funds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0174" num="0173">Further, while conventional block-chain ledgers may enable an individual to verify if the product has an authentic chain of custody, manufacturers would have very little control over the distribution channels and how their products are traded. Through the disclosed embodiments, these same manufacturers would have the ability to identify goods not offered for sale, or set targeted minimum pricing for certain geographies to address “grey-market activities” associated with these products.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0175" num="0174">For instances, a customer of business entity <b class="style-scope patent-text">150</b> may be a manufacturer and direct sale merchant of a specialized biomedical product with strict export regulations and a targeted regional sale strategy. The customer may work with business entity <b class="style-scope patent-text">150</b> to incorporate regional sales rules into a hybrid block-chain ledger for each product during manufacturing (e.g., within event trigger list <b class="style-scope patent-text">322</b> and rules engine <b class="style-scope patent-text">324</b>). Due to import restrictions one of the rules may specify a location of sales for each product, and a manufacturer may receive an automated message indicating that a product intended for a developing market is being transacted in the Europe. Working with business entity <b class="style-scope patent-text">150</b> and local authorities, the financial transaction is flagged, and the product recovered due to usage agreement violations. In some aspects, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may perform operations that revert an immediately prior transaction back to the customer to facilitate the recovery of their products for proper deployments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0176" num="0175">i. Value Tracking Using Block-Chain Ledgers to Capture Customer Interactions</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0177" num="0176">Today, a deep understanding of the relationship between a customer and a business is paramount in delivering a legendary customer experience. Unfortunately, the fragmented nature of existing corporate structures presents a complex challenge in trying to accurately capture the various touch points experienced by a customer. This is especially true of large corporate entities such as financial institutions, which offers a wide portfolio of products which may operate as separate lines-of-businesses (LOBs) under the same corporate banner. The fragmented nation of these existing corporate structures can thus lead to multiple approaches in providing customer service. The lack of cross-LOB integration may lead to an environment with very low cohesive customer management, which may also lead to an inability to track and quantify cross-LOB referrals and interactions. The disclosed embodiments may provide mechanisms for tracking customer interactions across different LOB's that provide not only a customer-centric view, but also with techniques for tracking the intrinsic value of each interaction with the customer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0178" num="0177">In some aspects, the exemplary hybrid block-chain ledgers described above may be configured to track and reward referral programs for a single customer in a multi-LOB environment. Within a hybrid block-chain ledger, the interactions and activities between a customer and staff can be recorded as a transaction, and the value generated by the transaction can be added to the hybrid block-chain ledger and compared the expected value of the referral. Effectively tracking the value of each interaction and referrals should allow greater visibility and transparency of the value generation chain. This increased transparency can be used to optimize the incentives for all participants.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0179" num="0178">Systems and processes consistent with the disclosed embodiments may, in some aspects, integrate all communication channels into a single tracking system, and provides a platform upon which referrals can be monetized. These exemplary systems and processes can further increase the value proposition for each customer going through this interaction. Thus, disclosed embodiments this exhibit advantages over existing systems which leverage conventional block-chain ledgers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0180" num="0179">The exemplary hybrid block-chain ledgers described above can further be augmented by allowing for incentives and payouts to occur in the transaction allowing for direct justification of the payouts. The augmentation would reduce the need to maintain records of all transaction, referrals and sales as it would be integrated into a single location in the hybrid block-chain ledgers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0181" num="0180">In the hybrid block-chain model described above, the rules surrounding how incentives and payouts are made can be controlled by a central authority, thereby automating the referral processes (e.g., in event trigger list <b class="style-scope patent-text">322</b> and/or rules engine <b class="style-scope patent-text">324</b>). The participants should be able to view the triggers which can translate to the actions, or thresholds associated with the incentives. But the actual distribution can be controlled by the rules engine hashed within in the exemplary hybrid block-chain ledger.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text" id="p-0182" num="0181">In some aspects, system <b class="style-scope patent-text">140</b> may combine multiple trigger events (e.g., within even trigger list <b class="style-scope patent-text">322</b>) to invoke the rules engine (e.g., rules engine <b class="style-scope patent-text">324</b>), which may change the set rewards and incentives. The multiple trigger events may include, but are not limited to, a certain transaction value, sale, customer interaction, a referral, and/or a combination thereof.</div>
