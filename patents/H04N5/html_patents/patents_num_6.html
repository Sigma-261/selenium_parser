    <div id="p-0001" num="0000" class="abstract style-scope patent-text">A video or still hand-held digital camera is activated or controlled based on estimation of a user head pose or gaze direction. The system comprises uses two wearable devices associated with right and left sides of the user body, each comprises an RF beacon. The head pose or gaze detection is estimated by comparing the signal strength (such as RSSI) or the phase of the RF signals from the wearable devices at the digital camera device. An angular deviation between the head pose (or gaze detection) and the digital camera (such as the line of sight) is estimated, and the digital camera is activated or controlled based on comparing the angular deviation to a set threshold. The RF signals may be Personal Area Network (PAN) signals, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals. The wearable devices may be head mounted, structured as glasses, earpieces, headphones, or hat mounted.</div>

    <div id="p-0006" num="0005" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">A digital camera <b class="style-scope patent-text">10</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS" class="style-scope patent-text">FIG. 1</figref> may be a digital still camera which converts captured image into an electric signal upon a specific control, or can be a video camera, wherein the conversion between captured images to the electronic signal is continuous (e.g., 24 frames per second). The camera <b class="style-scope patent-text">10</b> is preferably a digital camera, wherein the video or still images are converted using an electronic image sensor <b class="style-scope patent-text">12</b>. The digital camera <b class="style-scope patent-text">10</b> includes a lens <b class="style-scope patent-text">11</b> (or few lenses) for focusing the received light centered around an optical axis <b class="style-scope patent-text">8</b> (referred to herein as a line-of-sight) onto the small semiconductor image sensor <b class="style-scope patent-text">12</b>. The optical axis <b class="style-scope patent-text">8</b> is an imaginary line along which there is some degree of rotational symmetry in the optical system, and typically passes through the center of curvature of the lens <b class="style-scope patent-text">11</b> and commonly coincides with the axis of the rotational symmetry of the sensor <b class="style-scope patent-text">12</b>. The image sensor <b class="style-scope patent-text">12</b> commonly includes a panel with a matrix of tiny light-sensitive diodes (photocells), converting the image light to electric charges and then to electric signals, thus creating a video picture or a still image by recording the light intensity. Charge-Coupled Devices (CCD) and CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) are commonly used as the light-sensitive diodes. Linear or area arrays of light-sensitive elements may be used, and the light sensitive sensors may support monochrome (black &amp; white), color or both. For example, the CCD sensor KAI-2093 Image Sensor 1920 (H)×1080 (V) Interline CCD Image Sensor or KAF-50100 Image Sensor 8176 (H)×6132 (V) Full-Frame CCD Image Sensor can be used, available from Image Sensor Solutions, Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, N.Y.</div>
    <div id="p-0007" num="0006" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">An image processor block <b class="style-scope patent-text">13</b> receives the analog signal from the image sensor <b class="style-scope patent-text">12</b>. The Analog Front End (AFE) in the block <b class="style-scope patent-text">13</b> filters, amplifies, and digitizes the signal, using an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter. The AFE further provides Correlated Double Sampling (CDS), and provides a gain control to accommodate varying illumination conditions. In the case of a CCD-based sensor <b class="style-scope patent-text">12</b>, a CCD AFE (Analog Front End) component may be used between the digital image processor <b class="style-scope patent-text">13</b> and the sensor <b class="style-scope patent-text">12</b>. Such an AFE may be based on VSP2560 <i class="style-scope patent-text">‘CCD Analog Front End for Digital Cameras</i>’ available from Texas Instruments Incorporated of Dallas, Tex., U.S.A. The block <b class="style-scope patent-text">13</b> further contains a digital image processor, which receives the digital data from the AFE, and processes this digital representation of the image to handle various industry-standards, and to execute various computations and algorithms. Preferably, additional image enhancements may be performed by the block <b class="style-scope patent-text">13</b> such as generating greater pixel density or adjusting color balance, contrast, and luminance. Further, the block <b class="style-scope patent-text">13</b> may perform other data management functions and processing on the raw digital image data. Commonly, the timing relationship of the vertical/horizontal reference signals and the pixel clock are also handled in this block. Digital Media System-on-Chip device TMS320DM357 available from Texas Instruments Incorporated of Dallas, Tex., U.S.A. is an example of a device implementing in a single chip (and associated circuitry) part or all of the image processor <b class="style-scope patent-text">13</b>, part or all of a video compressor <b class="style-scope patent-text">14</b> and part or all of a transceiver <b class="style-scope patent-text">15</b>. In addition to a lens or lens system, color filters may be placed between the imaging optics and the photosensor array <b class="style-scope patent-text">12</b> to achieve desired color manipulation.</div>
    <div id="p-0008" num="0007" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The processing block <b class="style-scope patent-text">13</b> converts the raw data received from the photosensor array <b class="style-scope patent-text">12</b> (which can be any internal camera format, including before or after Bayer translation) into a color-corrected image in a standard image file format. The camera <b class="style-scope patent-text">10</b> further comprises a connector <b class="style-scope patent-text">19</b>, and a transmitter or a transceiver <b class="style-scope patent-text">15</b> is disposed between the connector <b class="style-scope patent-text">19</b> and the image processor <b class="style-scope patent-text">13</b>. The transceiver <b class="style-scope patent-text">15</b> may further includes isolation magnetic components (e.g. transformer-based), balancing, surge protection, and other suitable components required for providing a proper and standard interface via the connector <b class="style-scope patent-text">19</b>. In the case of connecting to a wired medium, the connector <b class="style-scope patent-text">19</b> further contains protection circuitry for accommodating transients, over-voltage and lightning, and any other protection means for reducing or eliminating the damage from an unwanted signal over the wired medium. A band pass filter may also be used for passing only the required communication signals, and rejecting or stopping other signals in the described path. A transformer may be used for isolating and reducing common-mode interferences. Further a wiring driver and wiring receivers may be used in order to transmit and receive the appropriate level of signal to and from the wired medium. An equalizer may also be used in order to compensate for any frequency dependent characteristics of the wired medium.</div>
    <div id="p-0009" num="0008" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Other image processing functions performed by the image processor <b class="style-scope patent-text">13</b> may include adjusting color balance, gamma and luminance, filtering pattern noise, filtering noise using Wiener filter, changing zoom factors, recropping, applying enhancement filters, applying smoothing filters, applying subject-dependent filters, and applying coordinate transformations. Other enhancements in the image data may include applying mathematical algorithms to generate greater pixel density or adjusting color balance, contrast and/or luminance.</div>
    <div id="p-0010" num="0009" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The image processing may further include an algorithm for motion detection by comparing the current image with a reference image and counting the number of different pixels, where the image sensor <b class="style-scope patent-text">12</b> or the digital camera <b class="style-scope patent-text">10</b> are assumed to be in a fixed location and thus assumed to capture the same image. Since images are naturally differ due to factors such as varying lighting, camera flicker, and CCD dark currents, pre-processing is useful to reduce the number of false positive alarms. Algorithms that are more complex are necessary to detect motion when the camera itself is moving, or when the motion of a specific object must be detected in a field containing other movement that can be ignored. Further, the video or image processing may use, or be based on, the algorithms and techniques disclosed in the book entitled: “<i class="style-scope patent-text">Handbook of Image </i>&amp; <i class="style-scope patent-text">Video Processing</i>”, edited by Al Bovik, by Academic Press, ISBN: 0-12-119790-5, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</div>
    <div id="p-0011" num="0010" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">A controller <b class="style-scope patent-text">18</b>, located within the camera device or module <b class="style-scope patent-text">10</b>, may be based on a discrete logic or an integrated device, such as a processor, microprocessor or microcomputer, and may include a general-purpose device or may be a special purpose processing device, such as an ASIC, PAL, PLA, PLD, Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Gate Array, or other customized or programmable device. In the case of a programmable device as well as in other implementations, a memory is required. The controller <b class="style-scope patent-text">18</b> commonly includes a memory that may include a static RAM (random Access Memory), dynamic RAM, flash memory, ROM (Read Only Memory), or any other data storage medium. The memory may include data, programs, and/or instructions and any other software or firmware executable by the processor. Control logic can be implemented in hardware or in software, such as a firmware stored in the memory. The controller <b class="style-scope patent-text">18</b> controls and monitors the device operation, such as initialization, configuration, interface, and commands.</div>
    <div id="p-0012" num="0011" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The digital camera device or module <b class="style-scope patent-text">10</b> requires power for its described functions such as for capturing, storing, manipulating, and transmitting the image. A dedicated power source may be used such as a battery or a dedicated connection to an external power source via connector <b class="style-scope patent-text">19</b>. The power supply may contain a DC/DC converter. In another embodiment, the power supply is power fed from the AC power supply via AC plug and a cord, and thus may include an AC/DC converter, for converting the AC power (commonly 115 VAC/60 Hz or 220 VAC/50 Hz) into the required DC voltage or voltages. Such power supplies are known in the art and typically involves converting 120 or 240 volt AC supplied by a power utility company to a well-regulated lower voltage DC for electronic devices. In one embodiment, the power supply is integrated into a single device or circuit, in order to share common circuits. Further, the power supply may include a boost converter, such as a buck boost converter, charge pump, inverter and regulators as known in the art, as required for conversion of one form of electrical power to another desired form and voltage. While the power supply (either separated or integrated) can be an integral part and housed within the camera <b class="style-scope patent-text">10</b> enclosure, it may be enclosed as a separate housing connected via cable to the camera <b class="style-scope patent-text">10</b> assembly. For example, a small outlet plug-in step-down transformer shape can be used (also known as wall-wart, “power brick”, “plug pack”, “plug-in adapter”, “adapter block”, “domestic mains adapter”, “power adapter”, or AC adapter). Further, the power supply may be a linear or switching type.</div>
    <div id="p-0013" num="0012" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Various formats that can be used to represent the captured image are TIFF (Tagged Image File Format), RAW format, AVI, DV, MOV, WMV, MP4, DCF (Design Rule for Camera Format), ITU-T H.261, ITU-T H.263, ITU-T H.264, ITU-T CCIR 601, ASF, Exif (Exchangeable Image File Format), and DPOF (Digital Print Order Format) standards. In many cases, video data is compressed before transmission, in order to allow its transmission over a reduced bandwidth transmission system. A video compressor <b class="style-scope patent-text">14</b> (or video encoder) is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS" class="style-scope patent-text">FIG. 26</figref> disposed between the image processor <b class="style-scope patent-text">13</b> and the transceiver <b class="style-scope patent-text">15</b>, allowing for compression of the digital video signal before its transmission over a cable or over-the-air. In some cases, compression may not be required, hence obviating the need for such compressor <b class="style-scope patent-text">14</b>. Such compression can be lossy or lossless types. Common compression algorithms are JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) and MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group). The above and other image or video compression techniques can make use of intraframe compression commonly based on registering the differences between part of single frame or a single image. Interframe compression can further be used for video streams, based on registering differences between frames. Other examples of image processing include run length encoding and delta modulation. Further, the image can be dynamically dithered to allow the displayed image to appear to have higher resolution and quality.</div>
    <div id="p-0014" num="0013" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The single lens or a lens array <b class="style-scope patent-text">11</b> is positioned to collect optical energy representative of a subject or a scenery, and to focus the optical energy onto the photosensor array <b class="style-scope patent-text">12</b>. Commonly, the photosensor array <b class="style-scope patent-text">12</b> is a matrix of photosensitive pixels, which generates an electric signal that is a representative of the optical energy directed at the pixel by the imaging optics. The captured image (still images or as video data) may be stored in a memory <b class="style-scope patent-text">17</b>, that may be volatile or non-volatile memory, and may be a built-in or removable media. Many stand-alone cameras use SD format, while a few use CompactFlash or other types. A LCD or TFT miniature display <b class="style-scope patent-text">16</b> typically serves as an Electronic ViewFinder (EVF) where the image captured by the lens is electronically displayed. The image on this display is used to assist in aiming the camera at the scene to be photographed. The sensor records the view through the lens; the view is then processed, and finally projected on a miniature display, which is viewable through the eyepiece. Electronic viewfinders are used in digital still cameras and in video cameras. Electronic viewfinders can show additional information, such as an image histogram, focal ratio, camera settings, battery charge, and remaining storage space. The display <b class="style-scope patent-text">16</b> may further display images captured earlier that are stored in the memory <b class="style-scope patent-text">17</b>.</div>
    <div id="p-0015" num="0014" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">While the digital camera <b class="style-scope patent-text">10</b> has been exampled above with regard to capturing a single image using the single lens <b class="style-scope patent-text">11</b> and the single sensor <b class="style-scope patent-text">12</b>, it is apparent that multiple images can be equally considered, using multiple image capturing mechanisms. An example of two capturing mechanisms is shown for a digital camera <b class="style-scope patent-text">10</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS" class="style-scope patent-text">FIG. 1<i class="style-scope patent-text">a</i> </figref>. Lenses <b class="style-scope patent-text">11</b> and <b class="style-scope patent-text">11</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a </i>are respectively associated with sensors <b class="style-scope patent-text">12</b> and <b class="style-scope patent-text">12</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a</i>, which in turn respectively connects to image processors <b class="style-scope patent-text">13</b> and <b class="style-scope patent-text">13</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a</i>. In the case where a compression function is used, video compressors <b class="style-scope patent-text">14</b> and <b class="style-scope patent-text">14</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a</i>, respectively, compress the data received from the processors <b class="style-scope patent-text">13</b> and <b class="style-scope patent-text">13</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a</i>. In one embodiment, two transceivers (each of the same as transceiver <b class="style-scope patent-text">15</b>, for example) and two ports (each of the same type as port <b class="style-scope patent-text">19</b>, for example) are used. Further, two communication mediums (each similar or the same as described above) can be employed, each carrying the image corresponding to the respective lens. Further, the same medium can be used using Frequency Division/Domain Multiplexing (FDM). In such an environment, each signal is carried in a dedicated frequency band, distinct from the other signals concurrently carried over the same medium. The signals are combined onto the medium and separated from the medium using various filtering schemes, employed in a multiplexer <b class="style-scope patent-text">21</b>. In another embodiment, the multiple images are carried using Time Domain/Division Multiplexing (TDM). The digital data stream from the video compressors <b class="style-scope patent-text">14</b> and <b class="style-scope patent-text">14</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">b </i>is multiplexed into a single stream by the multiplexer <b class="style-scope patent-text">21</b>, serving as a time multiplexer. The combined signal is then fed to the single transceiver <b class="style-scope patent-text">15</b> for transmitting onto the medium. Using two or more image-capturing components can further be used to provide stereoscopic video, allowing 3-D or any other stereoscopic view of the content, or other methods of improving the displayed image quality of functionality.</div>

No. 5,189,463 to Axelrod et al. entitled: “Camera Aiming Mechanism and Method”, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. The intermittent reading results in intermissions between readings. The invention also includes a radiant energy source that works with the camera. The radiant energy source produces a beam of radiant energy and projects the beam during intermissions between readings. The beam produces a light pattern on an object within or near the camera's field of view, thereby identifying at least a part of the field of view. The radiant energy source is often a laser and the radiant energy beam is often a laser beam. A detection mechanism that detects the intermissions and produces a signal that causes the radiant energy source to project the radiant energy beam. The detection mechanism is typically an electrical circuit including a retriggerable multivibrator or other functionally similar component.</div>
    <div id="p-0024" num="0023" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Shutter button. A shutter-release button (sometimes just shutter release or shutter button) is a push-button found on many cameras, used to take a picture when pushed. When pressed, the shutter of the camera is “released”, so that it opens to capture a picture, and then closes, allowing an exposure time as determined by the shutter speed setting (which may be automatic). The term “release” comes from old mechanical shutters that were “cocked” or “tensioned” by one lever, and then “released” by another. In modern or digital photography, this notion is less meaningful, so the term “shutter button” is more used.</div>
    <div id="p-0025" num="0024" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Image. A digital image is a numeric representation (normally binary) of a two-dimensional image. Depending on whether the image resolution is fixed, it may be of a vector or raster type. Raster images have a finite set of digital values, called picture elements or pixels. The digital image contains a fixed number of rows and columns of pixels, which are the smallest individual element in an image, holding quantized values that represent the brightness of a given color at any specific point. Typically, the pixels are stored in computer memory as a raster image or raster map, a two-dimensional array of small integers, where these values are commonly transmitted or stored in a compressed form. The raster images can be created by a variety of input devices and techniques, such as digital cameras, scanners, coordinate-measuring machines, seismographic profiling, airborne radar, and more. Common image formats include GIF, JPEG, and PNG.</div>
    <div id="p-0026" num="0025" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The Graphics Interchange Format (better known by its acronym GIF) is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel for each image, allowing a single image to reference its palette of up to 256 different colors chosen from the 24-bit RGB color space. It also supports animations and allows a separate palette of up to 256 colors for each frame. GIF images are compressed using the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) lossless data compression technique to reduce the file size without degrading the visual quality. The GIF (GRAPHICS INTERCHANGE FORMAT) Standard Version 89a is available from www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif89a.txt.</div>
    <div id="p-0027" num="0026" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">JPEG (seen most often with the .jpg or .jpeg filename extension) is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography. The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality and typically achieves 10:1 compression with little perceptible loss in image quality. JPEG/Exif is the most common image format used by digital cameras and other photographic image capture devices, along with JPEG/JFIF. The term “JPEG” is an acronym for the Joint Photographic Experts Group, which created the standard. JPEG/JFIF supports a maximum image size of 65535×65535 pixels—one to four gigapixels (1000 megapixels), depending on the aspect ratio (from panoramic 3:1 to square). JPEG is standardized under as ISO/IEC 10918-1:1994 entitled: “Information technology—Digital compression and coding of continuous-tone still images: Requirements and guidelines”.</div>
    <div id="p-0028" num="0027" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Portable Network Graphics (PNG) is a raster graphics file format that supports lossless data compression that was created as an improved replacement for Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), and is the commonly used lossless image compression format on the Internet. PNG supports palette-based images (with palettes of 24-bit RGB or 32-bit RGBA colors), grayscale images (with or without alpha channel), and full-color non-palette-based RGBimages (with or without alpha channel). PNG was designed for transferring images on the Internet, not for professional-quality print graphics, and, therefore, does not support non-RGB color spaces such as CMYK. PNG was published as an ISO/IEC15948:2004 standard entitled: “Information technology—Computer graphics and image processing—Portable Network Graphics (PNG): Functional specification”.</div>
    <div id="p-0029" num="0028" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Metadata. The term “metadata”, as used herein, refers to data that describes characteristics, attributes, or parameters of other data, in particular, files (such as program files) and objects. Such data is typically structured information that describes, explains, locates, and otherwise makes it easier to retrieve and use an information resource. Metadata typically includes structural metadata, relating to the design and specification of data structures or “data about the containers of data”; and descriptive metadata about individual instances of application data or the data content. Metadata may include the means of creation of the data, the purpose of the data, time and date of creation, the creator or author of the data, the location on a computer network where the data were created, and the standards used.</div>
    <div id="p-0030" num="0029" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">For example, metadata associated with a computer word processing file might include the title of the document, the name of the author, the company to whom the document belongs, the dates that the document was created and last modified, keywords which describe the document, and other descriptive data. While some of this information may also be included in the document itself (e.g., title, author, and data), metadata may be a separate collection of data that may be stored separately from, but associated with, the actual document. One common format for documenting metadata is eXtensible Markup Language (XML). XML provides a formal syntax, which supports the creation of arbitrary descriptions, sometimes called “tags.” An example of a metadata entry might be &lt;title&gt;War and Peace&lt;/title&gt;, where the bracketed words delineate the beginning and end of the group of characters that constitute the title of the document that is described by the metadata. In the example of the word processing file, the metadata (sometimes referred to as “document properties”) is entered manually by the author, the editor, or the document manager. The metadata concept is further described in a National Information Standards Organization (NISO) Booklet entitled: “Understanding Metadata” (ISBN: 1-880124-62-9), in the IETF RFC 5013 entitled: “The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set”, and in the IETF RFC 2731 entitled: “Encoding Dublin Core Metadata in HTML”, which are all incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. An extraction of metadata from files or objects is described in a U.S. Pat. No. 8,700,626 to Bedingfield, entitled: “Systems, Methods and Computer Products for Content-Derived Metadata”, and in a U.S. Patent Application Publication 2012/0278705 to Yang et al., entitled: “System and Method for Automatically Extracting Metadata from Unstructured Electronic Documents”, which are both incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</div>
    <div id="p-0031" num="0030" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Metadata can be stored either internally in the same file, object, or structure as the data (this is also called internal or embedded metadata), or externally in a separate file or field separated from the described data. A data repository typically stores the metadata detached from the data, but can be designed to support embedded metadata approaches. Metadata can be stored in either human-readable or binary form. Storing metadata in a human-readable format such as XML can be useful because users can understand and edit it without specialized tools, however, these formats are rarely optimized for storage capacity, communication time, and processing speed. A binary metadata format enables efficiency in all these respects, but requires special libraries to convert the binary information into a human-readable content.</div>
    <div id="p-0032" num="0031" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Tag. A tag is a type of metadata relating to non-hierarchical keyword or term assigned to a digital image, describing the image and allows it to be found again by browsing or searching. Tags may be chosen informally and personally by the item's creator or by its viewer, depending on the system.</div>
    <div id="p-0033" num="0032" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Optical flow. Optical flow or optic flow is the pattern of apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene caused by the relative motion between an observer (an eye or a camera) and the scene. Motion estimation is the process of determining motion vectors that describe the transformation from one 2D image to another, usually from adjacent frames in a video sequence. The motion vectors may be represented by a translational model or by many other models that can approximate the motion of a real video camera, such as rotation and translation in all three dimensions and zoom. Optical flow techniques are described in an article by David J. Fleet and Yair Weiss entitled: “Optical Flow Estimation”, and in an article by J. L. Baron, D. J. Fleet, and S. S.

    <div id="p-0045" num="0044" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Auto focus. An automatic focus (a.k.a. autofocus or AF) optical system uses a sensor, a control system and a motor or tunable optical element to focus on an automatically or manually selected point or area. An electronic rangefinder has a display instead of the motor; the adjustment of the optical system has to be done manually until indication. Autofocus methods are distinguished by their type as being either active, passive or hybrid variants. Autofocus systems rely on one or more sensors to determine correct focus, where some AF systems rely on a single sensor, while others use an array of sensors. Most modern SLR cameras use through-the-lens optical AF sensors, with a separate sensor array providing light metering, although the latter can be programmed to prioritize its metering to the same area as one or more of the AF sensors. Through-the-lens optical autofocusing is often speedier and more precise than can be achieved manually with an ordinary viewfinder, although a more precise manual focus may be achieved with special accessories, such as focusing magnifiers. Autofocus accuracy within ⅓ of the depth of field (DOF) at the widest aperture of the lens is common in professional AF SLR cameras.</div>
    <div id="p-0046" num="0045" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Most multi-sensor AF cameras allow manual selection of the active sensor, and many offer automatic selection of the sensor using algorithms, which attempt to discern the location of the subject. Some AF cameras are able to detect whether the subject is moving towards or away from the camera, including speed and acceleration data, keep focus on the subject, and is used mainly in sports and other action photography. The data collected from AF sensors is used to control an electromechanical system that adjusts the focus of the optical system. A variation of autofocus is an electronic rangefinder, a system in which focus data are provided to the operator, but adjustment of the optical system is still performed manually. The speed of the AF system is highly dependent on the maximum aperture offered by the lens. F-stops of around f/2 to f/2.8 are generally considered optimal in terms of focusing speed and accuracy. Faster lenses than this (e.g., f/1.4 or f/1.8) typically have very low depth of field, meaning that it takes longer to achieve correct focus, despite the increased amount of light.</div>
    <div id="p-0047" num="0046" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Active AF systems measure distance to the subject independently of the optical system, and subsequently adjust the optical system for correct focus. There are various ways to measure distance, including ultrasonic sound waves and infrared light. In the first case, sound waves are emitted from the camera, and by measuring the delay in their reflection, distance to the subject is calculated. An exception to the two-step approach is the mechanical autofocus provided in some enlargers, which adjust the lens directly.</div>
    <div id="p-0048" num="0047" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Passive AF systems determine correct focus by performing passive analysis of the image that is entering the optical system. They generally do not direct any energy, such as ultrasonic sound or infrared light waves, toward the subject. However, an autofocus assist beam of usually infrared light is required when there is not enough light to take passive measurements. Passive autofocusing can be achieved by phase detection or contrast measurement.</div>
    <div id="p-0049" num="0048" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Shutter button. A shutter-release button (sometimes just shutter release or shutter button) is a push-button found on many cameras, used to take a picture when pushed. When pressed, the shutter of the camera is “released”, so that it opens to capture a picture, and then closes, allowing an exposure time as determined by the shutter speed setting (which may be automatic). The term “release” comes from old mechanical shutters that were “cocked” or “tensioned” by one lever, and then “released” by another. In modern or digital photography, this notion is less meaningful, so the term “shutter button” is more used.</div>
    <div id="p-0050" num="0049" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Distance meter. In many trades and industries there is a need for fast and accurate non-contact distance measuring tool. For example, in the construction industry and trades, distance meters (also known as range-finders) are commonly used for many applications as a substitute to the old-fashioned contact-based tape measure, providing speed, accuracy, versatility, convenience, and functionality. Laser distance-measuring devices are widely used in a variety of applications, such as power engineering, hydraulic engineering, architecture, geographic investigation, and athletic ranging, for measuring distance between two stationary objects. By way of example, measurement of wall length is a common requirement for real estate agents, carpenters, carpet layers, painters, architects, interior decorators, builders and others who need to know interior wall dimensions in their respective professions.</div>
    <div id="p-0051" num="0050" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Various applications of distance meters are described in Application Note by Fluke Corporation (May 2012, 3361276C_EN) entitled: “101 <i class="style-scope patent-text">applications for laser distance meters</i>”, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. Other Applications include surveying, navigation, to permit focus in photography, choosing a golf club according to distance, and correcting aim of a projectile weapon for distance. A device that measure distance from the observer to a target is commonly referred to as a rangefinder. Distance measuring devices may use active methods to measure (such as ultrasonic ranging module, laser rangefinder, radar distance measurement), while others measure distance using trigonometry (stadiametric rangefinders and parallax, or coincidence, rangefinders). In a typical use of a rangefinder for golf, one will aim the reticle at the flagstick and press a button to get the yardage. Users of firearms use long distance rangefinders to measure the distance to a target in order to allow for projectile drop. Rangefinders are also used for surveying in forestry, where special devices with anti-leaf filters are used.</div>

    <div id="p-0057" num="0056" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Reflection (or backscattering) is the change in direction of a wavefront at an interface between two different media, so that the wavefront returns into the medium from which it originated. Common examples include the reflection of light, sound, and water waves, and the law of reflection is that for specular reflection the angle at which the wave is incident on the surface equals the angle at which it is reflected.</div>
    <div id="p-0058" num="0057" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In one example, a single component, typically a transducer is used as both the emitter <b class="style-scope patent-text">24</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a </i>and the sensor <b class="style-scope patent-text">24</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">b</i>. During transmission, the transducer serves as the emitter <b class="style-scope patent-text">24</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a </i>and is coupled to the transmission path (such as to the signal conditioner <b class="style-scope patent-text">27</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">aa</i>) to emit the incident wave signal <b class="style-scope patent-text">26</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a</i>. During reception, the transducer serves as the sensor <b class="style-scope patent-text">24</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">b </i>and is coupled to the reception path (such as to the signal conditioner <b class="style-scope patent-text">27</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">ba</i>) to sense or detect the reflected (or backscattered) wave signal <b class="style-scope patent-text">26</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">b</i>. Typically a duplexer is connected between the transducer, the transmission path (such as to the signal conditioner <b class="style-scope patent-text">27</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">aa</i>), and the reception path (such as to the signal conditioner <b class="style-scope patent-text">27</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">ba</i>). The duplexer is typically an electronic component or circuit that allows for a bi-directional (duplex) connection to the transducer to be shared by the transmission and the reception paths, while providing isolation therebetween. The duplexer may be based on frequency, commonly by using filters (such as a waveguide filter), on polarization (such as an orthomode transducer), or timing. The duplexer is designed for operation in the frequency band or bands used by both the transmission and the reception paths, and is capable of handling the output power of the transmitter that is provided to the transducer. Further, the duplexer provides a rejection of the transmitter noise occurring at a receive frequency during reception time, and further provides an isolation of the reception path from the transmitted power or transmission path in order to minimize desensitization or saturation of the reception path or components therein.</div>
    <div id="p-0059" num="0058" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In one example, a distance meter uses a radar. A horn antenna is serving as the transducer and is used for both transmitting and receiving electro-magnetic microwave signals, and the duplexer is implemented as a circulator. The circulator may be a passive non-reciprocal three-port device, in which a microwave or radio frequency signal entering any port is transmitted to the next port in rotation (only). A port in this context is a point where an external waveguide or transmission line (such as a microstrip line or a coaxial cable), connects to the device. For a three-port circulator, a signal applied to port <b class="style-scope patent-text">1</b> only comes out of port <b class="style-scope patent-text">2</b>; a signal applied to port <b class="style-scope patent-text">2</b> only comes out of port <b class="style-scope patent-text">3</b>; a signal applied to port <b class="style-scope patent-text">3</b> only comes out of port <b class="style-scope patent-text">1</b>. The circulator is used as a type of duplexer, to route signals from the transmitter to the antenna and from the antenna to the receiver, without allowing signals to pass directly from transmitter to receiver. The circulator may be a ferrite circulator or a non-ferrite circulator. Ferrite circulators are composed of magnetized ferrite materials, and are typically 3-port “Y-junction” based on cancellation of waves propagating over two different paths near a magnetized material. Waveguide circulators may be of either type, while the 3-port type are more compact and are based on striplines. A permanent magnet may be used to produce the magnetic flux through the waveguide. Ferrimagnetic garnet crystal is used in optical circulators. Passive circulators are described in an application note AN98035 released Mar. 23, 1998 by Philips Semiconductors N.V. entitled: “Circulators and Isolators, unique passive devices”, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. The circulator may consist of, comprise, use, or be based on, a phase shift circulator, a Faraday rotation circulator, a ring circulator, a junction circulator, an edge guided mode circulator, or a lumped element circulator.</div>
    <div id="p-0060" num="0059" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Laser. A laser (an acronym for “Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation”) is a technology or device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation, where the term “light” includes electromagnetic radiation of any frequency, not only visible light, such as infrared laser, ultraviolet laser, or X-ray laser. A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light coherently. Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, and further allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances (collimation), enabling applications such as laser pointers. Lasers can also have high temporal coherence, which allows them to emit light with a very narrow spectrum, i.e., they can emit a single color of light. Temporal coherence can be used to produce pulses of light as short as a femtosecond. Lasers are distinguished from other light sources by their coherence. Spatial coherence is typically expressed through the output being a narrow beam, which is diffraction-limited. Laser beams can be focused to very tiny spots, achieving a very high irradiance, or they can have very low divergence in order to concentrate their power at a great distance.</div>
    <div id="p-0061" num="0060" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Temporal (or longitudinal) coherence implies a polarized wave at a single frequency whose phase is correlated over a relatively great distance (the coherence length) along the beam. A beam produced by a thermal or other incoherent light source has an instantaneous amplitude and phase that vary randomly with respect to time and position, thus having a short coherence length. Lasers are commonly characterized according to their wavelength in a vacuum, and most “single wavelength” lasers actually produce radiation in several modes having slightly differing frequencies (wavelengths), often not in a single polarization. Although temporal coherence implies monochromaticity, there are lasers that emit a broad spectrum of light or emit different wavelengths of light simultaneously. There are some lasers that are not single spatial mode and consequently have light beams that diverge more than is required by the diffraction limit. However, all such devices are classified as “lasers” based on their method of producing light, i.e., stimulated emission. Lasers are typically employed in applications where light of the required spatial or temporal coherence could not be produced using simpler technologies.</div>
    <div id="p-0062" num="0061" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In one example, distance measuring is based on the electro-optical techniques, where the measuring uses light waves, where the transmitted beam <b class="style-scope patent-text">26</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a </i>and the reflected (or backscattered) beams <b class="style-scope patent-text">26</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">b </i>are visible or non-visible light beams.

Laser ranging is described in 2001 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers paper (Opt.

    <div id="p-0063" num="0062" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Reflection of light is either specular (mirror-like), backscattered, or diffused (retaining the energy, but losing the image) depending on the nature of the interface. In specular reflection the phase of the reflected (or backscattered) waves depends on the choice of the origin of coordinates, but the relative phase between s and p (TE and TM) polarizations is fixed by the properties of the media and of the interface between them. A mirror provides the most common model for specular light reflection, and typically consists of a glass sheet with a metallic coating where the reflection actually occurs. Reflection is commonly enhanced in metals by suppression of wave propagation beyond their skin depths. Reflection also occurs at the surface of transparent media, such as water or glass. In fact, reflection of light may occur whenever light travels from a medium of a given refractive index into a medium with a different refractive index. In the most general case, a certain fraction of the light is reflected from the interface, and the remainder is refracted. Solving Maxwell's equations for a light ray striking a boundary allows the derivation of the Fresnel equations, which can be used to predict how much of the light is reflected (or backscattered), and how much is refracted in a given situation. This is analogous to the way impedance mismatch in an electric circuit causes reflection of signals. Total internal reflection of light from a denser medium occurs if the angle of incidence is above the critical angle. When light reflects off a material denser (with higher refractive index) than the external medium, it undergoes a polarity inversion. In contrast, a less dense, lower refractive index material will reflect light in phase.</div>
    <div id="p-0064" num="0063" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">When light strikes the surface of a (non-metallic) material it bounces off in all directions due to multiple reflections by the microscopic irregularities inside the material (e.g., the grain boundaries of a polycrystalline material, or the cell or fiber boundaries of an organic material) and by its surface, if it is rough. Thus, an ‘image’ is not formed, and this is called diffuse reflection. The exact form of the reflection depends on the structure of the material. One common model for diffuse reflection is Lambertian reflectance, in which the light is reflected with equal luminance (in photometry) or radiance (in radiometry) in all directions, as defined by Lambert's cosine law. The light sent to our eyes by most of the objects we see is due to diffuse reflection from their surface, so that this is our primary mechanism of physical observation.

    <div id="p-0082" num="0081" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Photosensor. A photosensor (or photodetector) is a sensor of light. A photosensor may be a semiconductor device, such as a photodiode or a phototransistor, and may use the photovoltaic effect of the photoconductive effects.</div>
    <div id="p-0083" num="0082" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Photodiode. A photodiode is a semiconductor device that converts light into current, where the current is generated when photons are absorbed in the photodiode. A small amount of current may also be produced when no light is present. Photodiodes may contain optical filters, built-in lenses, and may have large or small surface areas, and usually have a slower response time as their surface area increases. Photodiodes are similar to regular semiconductor diodes except that they may be either exposed (to detect vacuum UV or X-rays) or packaged with a window or optical fiber connection to allow light to reach the sensitive part of the device. Many diodes designed for use specifically as a photodiode use a PIN junction rather than a p-n junction, to increase the speed of response. A photodiode is typically designed to operate in reverse bias.</div>
    <div id="p-0084" num="0083" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">A photodiode use a p-n junction or PIN structure, and when a photon of sufficient energy strikes the diode, it creates an electron-hole pair. This mechanism is also known as the inner photoelectric effect. If the absorption occurs in the junction depletion region, or one diffusion length away from it, these carriers are swept from the junction by the built-in electric field of the depletion region, and thus holes move toward the anode, and electrons toward the cathode, and a photocurrent is produced. The total current through the photodiode is the sum of the dark current (current that is generated in the absence of light) and the photocurrent, so the dark current must be minimized to maximize the sensitivity of the device.</div>
    <div id="p-0085" num="0084" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">When used in zero bias or photovoltaic mode, the flow of photocurrent out of the device is restricted and a voltage builds up. This mode exploits the photovoltaic effect, which is the basis for solar cells—a traditional solar cell is just a large area photodiode. In a photoconductive mode, the diode is often reverse biased (with the cathode driven positive with respect to the anode). This reduces the response time because the additional reverse bias increases the width of the depletion layer, which decreases the junction's capacitance. The reverse bias also increases the dark current without much change in the photocurrent. For a given spectral distribution, the photocurrent is linearly proportional to the illuminance (and to the irradiance). Although this mode is faster, the photoconductive mode tends to exhibit more electronic noise. The leakage current of a good PIN diode is so low (&lt;1 nA) that the Johnson-Nyquist noise of the load resistance in a typical circuit often dominates. In addition to emission, an LED can be used as a photodiode in light detection, and this capability may be used in a variety of applications including ambient light detection and bidirectional communications. As a photodiode, an LED is sensitive to wavelengths equal to or shorter than the predominant wavelength it emits. For example, a green LED is sensitive to blue light and to some green light, but not to yellow or red light.</div>
    <div id="p-0086" num="0085" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">PIN diode. A PIN diode is a diode with a wide, undoped intrinsic semiconductor region between a p-type semiconductor and an n-type semiconductor region. The p-type and n-type regions are typically heavily doped because they are used for ohmic contacts, and the wide intrinsic region is in contrast to an ordinary PN diode. The wide intrinsic region makes the PIN diode an inferior rectifier (one typical function of a diode), but it makes the PIN diode suitable for attenuators, fast switches, photodetectors, and high voltage power electronics applications. A PIN diode operates under what is known as high-level injection. In other words, the intrinsic “i” region is flooded with charge carriers from the “p” and “n” regions. The diode will conduct current once the flooded electrons and holes reach an equilibrium point, where the number of electrons is equal to the number of holes in the intrinsic region. When the diode is forward biased, the injected carrier concentration is typically several orders of magnitude higher than the intrinsic level carrier concentration. Due to this high level injection, which in turn is due to the depletion process, the electric field extends deeply (almost the entire length) into the region. This electric field helps in speeding up of the transport of charge carriers from P to N region, which results in faster operation of the diode, making it a suitable device for high frequency operations. As a photodetector, the PIN diode is reverse biased. Under reverse bias, the diode ordinarily does not conduct (save a small dark current or Is leakage). When a photon of sufficient energy enters the depletion region of the diode, it creates an electron—hole pair. The reverse bias field sweeps the carriers out of the region creating a current. Some detectors can use avalanche multiplication.</div>
    <div id="p-0087" num="0086" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Avalanche photodiode. An Avalanche photodiodes have a similar structure to regular photodiodes, but they are operated with much higher reverse bias. This allows each photo-generated carrier to be multiplied by avalanche breakdown, resulting in internal gain within the photodiode, which increases the effective responsivity of the device. An avalanche photodiode (APD) is a highly sensitive semiconductor electronic device that exploits the photoelectric effect to convert light to electricity. APDs can be thought of as photodetectors that provide a built-in first stage of gain through avalanche multiplication. From a functional standpoint, they can be regarded as the semiconductor analog to photomultipliers. By applying a high reverse bias voltage (typically 100-200 V in silicon), APDs show an internal current gain effect (around 100) due to impact ionization (avalanche effect). However, some silicon APDs employ alternative doping and beveling techniques compared to traditional APDs that allow greater voltage to be applied (&gt;1500 V) before breakdown is reached and hence a greater operating gain (&gt;1000). In general, the higher the reverse voltage the higher the gain. If very high gain is needed (105 to 106), certain APDs (single-photon avalanche diodes) can be operated with a reverse voltage above the APD's breakdown voltage. In this case, the APD needs to have its signal current limited and quickly diminished. Active and passive current quenching techniques have been used for this purpose. APDs that operate in this high-gain regime are in Geiger mode. This mode is particularly useful for single photon detection when the dark count event rate is sufficiently low.</div>
    <div id="p-0088" num="0087" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Phototransistor. A phototransistor is a light-sensitive transistor. A common type of phototransistor, called a photobipolar transistor, is in essence a bipolar transistor encased in a transparent case so that light can reach the base-collector junction. The electrons that are generated by photons in the base-collector junction are injected into the base, and this photodiode current is amplified by the transistor's current gain β (or hfe). If the emitter is left unconnected, the phototransistor becomes a photodiode. While phototransistors have a higher responsivity for light, they are not able to detect low levels of light any better than photodiodes. Phototransistors also have significantly longer response times. Field-effect phototransistors, also known as photoFETs, are light-sensitive field-effect transistors. Unlike photobipolar transistors, photoFETs control drain-source current by creating a gate voltage.</div>

A Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) is a device for the movement of electrical charge, usually from within the device to an area where the charge can be manipulated, for example conversion into a digital value. This is achieved by “shifting” the signals between stages within the device one at a time. CCDs move charge between capacitive bins in the device, with the shift allowing for the transfer of charge between bins. In a CCD image sensor, pixels are represented by p-doped MOS capacitors. These capacitors are biased above the threshold for inversion when image acquisition begins, allowing the conversion of incoming photons into electron charges at the semiconductor-oxide interface; the CCD is then used to read out these charges. CCD image sensors are widely used in professional, medical, and scientific applications where high-quality image data is required.</div>
    <div id="p-0091" num="0090" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">An ultrasonic distance measurement principle is based on an ultrasonic transmitter that emits an ultrasonic wave in one direction, and started timing when it launched. Ultrasonic spread in the air, and would return immediately when it encountered obstacles on the way. At last, the ultrasonic receiver would stop timing when it received the reflected wave. As Ultrasonic spread velocity is about 340 meters/second in the air, based on the timer record ‘t’, we can calculate the distance (s) between the obstacle and transmitter, namely: s=340t/2, which is so-called time difference distance measurement principle The principle of ultrasonic distance measurement used the already-known air spreading velocity, measuring the time from launch to reflection when it encountered obstacle, and then calculate the distance between the transmitter and the obstacle according to the time and the velocity. Thus, the principle of ultrasonic distance measurement is the same with radar. Distance Measurement formula is expressed as: L=C×T, where in the formula, L is the measured distance, and C is the ultrasonic spreading velocity in air, also, T represents time (T is half the time value from transmitting to receiving).</div>
    <div id="p-0092" num="0091" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">When a longitudinal sound wave strikes a flat surface, sound is reflected (or backscattered) in a coherent manner, provided that the dimension of the reflective surface is large compared to the wavelength of the sound. Note that audible sound has a very wide frequency range (from 20 to about 20,000 Hz), and thus a very wide range of wavelengths (from about 20 mm to 20 m). As a result, the overall nature of the reflection varies according to the texture and structure of the surface. For example, porous materials will absorb some energy, and rough materials (where rough is relative to the wavelength) tend to reflect in many directions—to scatter the energy, rather than to reflect it coherently.</div>
    <div id="p-0093" num="0092" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In the pulse echo method, an ultrasonic pulse having a frequency typically ranging from about 20 kHz to about 100 kHz is generated and transmitted to an object at time TO. Then, the ultrasonic pulse is reflected (or backscattered) from the object, thereby an echo pulse of the ultrasonic pulse being detected by a sensor at time T1. In this regard, a propagation time of the pulse can be defined to be (T1−T0) and, accordingly a distance to the object can be given by a half of a multiplication of the propagation time and a velocity of an ultrasonic wave c, i.e., (0.5×(T1−T0)×c), wherein a velocity of an ultrasonic wave c is a known value. One of good reasons to adopt an ultrasonic wave having a frequency ranging from 20 kHz to 100 kHz is to implement a high directivity of an ultrasonic pulse in the air. Generally, when a piston-shaped ultrasonic wave generator having a radius a harmonically oscillates with a frequency set to ‘f’, an ultrasonic wave beam propagates through the air with a form of a nearly planar wave in a near field. However, the beam becomes spread wide, thereby having a form of a circular cone in a far field, by a diffraction thereof in proportional to a propagating distance. Accordingly, a beam width becomes larger as the wave propagates farther from the wave generator and, consequently, an angle is formed between an outermost sideline of the propagating beam and a central direction line of the propagation. The angle of convergence of the ultrasonic wave is inversely proportional to the frequency f and the radius a of the piston-shaped ultrasonic wave generator. As the angle of convergence becomes smaller, the beam width of the ultrasonic wave becomes narrower and, resultantly, a spatial resolution can be increased. Therefore, it is generally desirable to minimize the beam width to achieve a high resolution in a spatial domain.</div>
    <div id="p-0094" num="0093" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The relation between the angle of convergence and the beam width of the ultrasonic wave teaches that the beam width is minimized by increasing the frequency f of the ultrasonic wave. However, the method of increasing the frequency of the ultrasonic wave has a drawback that a measurable range of a distance decreases, because the ultrasonic wave is attenuated in proportional to square of the frequency. Another method for minimizing the beam width is to increase the radius a of the piston-shaped ultrasonic wave generator. However, it is practically difficult to implement the larger radius of the piston-shaped ultrasonic wave generator mechanically. Furthermore, a size of a sensor therein becomes large in proportional to the diameter thereof. For the reasons stated above, the commonly used sensors has the radius which is less than or equal to 15 mm, and measures the distance by using the ultrasonic wave at the frequency of 40 kHz. Meanwhile, a directivity characteristic of the sensors can be represented with a half power beam width 2θHP (hereinafter, referred to as HPBW for simplicity). For example, for a commonly used sensor having the radius of 12 mm and using the frequency of 40 kHz, the HPBW is known to be about 20 degrees. In this case, the beam width of the wave becomes larger than 1 mat a 5 m distant place from the sensor. In this regard, although the beam width is also slightly dependent on other factors, e.g., duration of the pulse or a source type (piston source or Gaussian source), the sensor having the aforementioned directivity characteristic is generally called to have the spatial resolution of 1 m at a 5 m distant place from the sensor.</div>

Ultrasounds (a.k.a. supersonic) are sound waves with frequencies higher than the upper audible limit of human hearing. Ultrasound is not different from ‘normal’ (audible) sound in its physical properties, only in that humans cannot hear it.

    <div id="p-0100" num="0099" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Ultrasonic transducers are transducers that convert ultrasound waves to electrical signals or vice versa. Those that both transmit and receive may also be called ultrasound transceivers; many ultrasound sensors besides being sensors are indeed transceivers because they can both sense and transmit. Active ultrasonic sensors generate high-frequency sound waves and evaluate the echo, which is received back by the sensor, measuring the time interval between sending the signal and receiving the echo to determine the distance to an object. Passive ultrasonic sensors are typically microphones that detect ultrasonic noise that is present under certain conditions, convert it to an electrical signal, and report it to a computer. Ultrasonic transducers are typically based on or using piezoelectric transducers or capacitive transducers. Piezoelectric crystals change size and shape when a voltage is applied; AC voltage makes them oscillate at the same frequency and produce ultrasonic sound. Capacitive transducers use electrostatic fields between a conductive diaphragm and a backing plate. The beam pattern of a transducer can be determined by the active transducer area and shape, the ultrasound wavelength, and the sound velocity of the propagation medium. Since piezoelectric materials generate a voltage when force is applied to them, they can also work as ultrasonic detectors. Some systems use separate transmitters and receivers, while others combine both functions into a single piezoelectric transceiver. Ultrasound transmitters can also use non-piezoelectric principles, such as magnetostriction. Materials with this property change size slightly when exposed to a magnetic field, and make practical transducers. A capacitor (“condenser”) microphone has a thin diaphragm that responds to ultrasound waves. Changes in the electric field between the diaphragm and a closely spaced backing plate convert sound signals to electric currents, which can be amplified.</div>

    <div id="p-0115" num="0114" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Antenna. An antenna (plural antennae or antennas), or aerial, is an electrical device which converts electric power into radio waves, and vice versa, and is usually used with a radio transmitter or radio receiver. In transmission, a radio transmitter supplies an electric current oscillating at radio frequency (i.e. a high frequency Alternating Current (AC)) to the antenna's terminals, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as electromagnetic waves (radio waves). In reception, an antenna intercepts some of the power of an electromagnetic wave in order to produce a tiny voltage at its terminals that is applied to a receiver to be amplified.</div>
    <div id="p-0116" num="0115" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Typically an antenna consists of an arrangement of metallic conductors (elements), electrically connected (often through a transmission line) to the receiver or transmitter. An oscillating current of electrons forced through the antenna by a transmitter will create an oscillating magnetic field around the antenna elements, while the charge of the electrons also creates an oscillating electric field along the elements. These time-varying fields radiate away from the antenna into space as a moving transverse electromagnetic field wave. Conversely, during reception, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of an incoming radio wave exert force on the electrons in the antenna elements, causing them to move back and forth, creating oscillating currents in the antenna. Antennas can be designed to transmit and receive radio waves in all horizontal directions equally (omnidirectional antennas), or preferentially in a particular direction (directional or high gain antennas). In the latter case, an antenna may also include additional elements or surfaces with no electrical connection to the transmitter or receiver, such as parasitic elements, parabolic reflectors or horns, which serve to direct the radio waves into a beam or other desired radiation pattern.</div>
    <div id="p-0117" num="0116" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Directional antenna. A directional antenna or beam antenna is an antenna that radiates or receives greater power in specific directions allowing for increased performance and reduced interference from unwanted sources. Directional antennas provide increased performance over dipole antennas—or omnidirectional antennas in general—when a greater concentration of radiation in a certain direction is desired. A High-Gain Antenna (HGA) is a directional antenna with a focused, narrow radiowave beam width. This narrow beam width allows more precise targeting of the radio signals. When transmitting, a high-gain antenna allows more of the transmitted power to be sent in the direction of the receiver, increasing the received signal strength. When receiving, a high gain antenna captures more of the signal, again increasing signal strength. Due to reciprocity, these two effects are equal—an antenna that makes a transmitted signal <b class="style-scope patent-text">100</b> times stronger (compared to an isotropic radiator), will also capture 100 times as much energy as the isotropic antenna when used as a receiving antenna. Due to their directivity, directional antennas also send less (and receive less) signal from directions other than the main beam. This property may be used to reduce interference. There are many ways to make a high-gain antenna—the most common are parabolic antennas, helical antennas, Yagi antennas, and phased arrays of smaller antennas of any kind. Horn antennas can also be constructed with high gain, but are less commonly seen.</div>
    <div id="p-0118" num="0117" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Aperture antenna. Aperture antennas are the main type of directional antennas used at microwave frequencies and above, and consist of a small dipole or loop feed antenna inside a three-dimensional guiding structure large compared to a wavelength, with an aperture to emit the radio waves. Since the antenna structure itself is nonresonant, they can be used over a wide frequency range by replacing or tuning the feed antenna. A parabolic antenna is widely used high gain antenna at microwave frequencies and above, and consists of a dish-shaped metal parabolic reflector with a feed antenna at the focus. It can have some of the highest gains of any antenna type, up to 60 dBi, but the dish must be large compared to a wavelength. A horn antenna is a simple antenna with moderate gains of 15 to 25 dBi consists of a flaring metal horn attached to a waveguide. Used for applications such as radar guns, radiometers and as feed antennas for parabolic dishes. A slot antenna consist of a waveguide with one or more slots cut in it to emit the microwaves. Linear slot antennas emit narrow fan-shaped beams, and are used as UHF broadcast antennas and marine radar antennas. A dielectric resonator antenna consists of small ball or puck-shaped piece of dielectric material excited by aperture in waveguide used at millimeter wave frequencies.</div>
    <div id="p-0119" num="0118" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Horn antenna. A horn antenna or microwave horn is an antenna that consists of a flaring metal waveguide shaped like a horn to direct radio waves in a beam. Horns are widely used as antennas at UHF and microwave frequencies, above 300 MHz, and are used as feeders (called feed horns) for larger antenna structures such as parabolic antennas, as standard calibration antennas to measure the gain of other antennas, and as directive antennas for such devices as radar guns, automatic door openers, and microwave radiometers. Their advantages are moderate directivity, low standing wave ratio (SWR), broad bandwidth, and simple construction and adjustment. An advantage of horn antennas is that since they have no resonant elements, they can operate over a wide range of frequencies, a wide bandwidth. The usable bandwidth of horn antennas is typically of the order of 10:1, and can be up to 20:1 (for example allowing it to operate from 1 GHz to 20 GHz). The input impedance is slowly varying over this wide frequency range, allowing low voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) over the bandwidth. The gain of horn antennas typically ranges up to 25 dBi, with 10-20 dBi being.</div>
    <div id="p-0120" num="0119" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Horns can have different flare angles as well as different expansion curves (elliptic, hyperbolic, etc.) in the E-field and H-field directions, making possible a wide variety of different beam profiles. A pyramidal horn is a common horn antenna with the horn in the shape of a four-sided pyramid, with a rectangular cross section, used with rectangular waveguides, and radiate linearly polarized radio waves. A sectoral horn is a pyramidal horn with only one pair of sides flared and the other pair parallel, and produces a fan-shaped beam, which is narrow in the plane of the flared sides, but wide in the plane of the narrow sides. An E-plane horn is a sectoral horn flared in the direction of the electric or E-field in the waveguide, an H-plane horn is a sectoral horn flared in the direction of the magnetic or H-field in the waveguide, and a conical horn is a horn in the shape of a cone, with a circular cross section, typically used with cylindrical waveguides. An exponential horn (also called a scalar horn) is a horn with curved sides, in which the separation of the sides increases as an exponential function of length, and can have pyramidal or conical cross sections. Exponential horns have minimum internal reflections, and almost constant impedance and other characteristics over a wide frequency range, and are used in applications requiring high performance, such as feed horns for communication satellite antennas and radio telescopes. A corrugated horn is a horn antenna with parallel slots or grooves, small compared with a wavelength, covering the inside surface of the horn, transverse to the axis. Corrugated horns have wider bandwidth and smaller sidelobes and cross-polarization, and are widely used as feed horns for satellite dishes and radio telescopes. A dual-mode conical horn may be used to replace the corrugated horn for use at sub-mm wavelengths where the corrugated horn is lossy and difficult to fabricate. A diagonal horn is a simple dual-mode horn superficially looks like a pyramidal horn with a square output aperture. However, the square output aperture is seen to be rotated 45° relative to the waveguide. These horns are typically machined into split blocks and used at sub-mm wavelengths. A ridged horn is a pyramidal horn with ridges or fins attached to the inside of the horn, extending down the center of the sides, and the fins lower the cutoff frequency, increasing the antenna's bandwidth. A septum horn is a horn, which is divided into several subhorns by metal partitions (septums) inside, attached to opposite walls.</div>

By use of frequency modulation the frequency of the transmitted radar signal of the radar-transmitter and -receiver is variable periodically according to a saw tooth function. The frequency of the beat signal, due to the travel time of the radar signal reflected by the object, represents a measured value for the distance of the object. A signal processing circuit generates from the beat signal obtained a measured value of the distance. For this purpose, the beat signal is fed into a phase control circuit or phase locked loop circuit the output frequency of which makes the measured value of distance.</div>

No. 5,341,144 to Stove entitled: “Vehicular Cruise Control System and Radar System Therefor”, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. The system comprises an R.F. source for providing a signal at a frequency, which increases over time from a base frequency f (Hz) at a rate r (Hz/s) for a sweep duration d(s). This signal is transmitted and a signal reflected by the target is mixed with a portion of the transmitted signal to give a signal having a frequency proportional to the range of the target. The R.F. source is arranged to have a sweep rate r equal to the base frequency f divided by a time t (s) which time is the delay until the target will be at the measured range. A predicted range may thus be derived without complex compensation for relative velocity. The system may further provide velocity feedback without requiring extra circuitry.</div>

The device generates an equivalent time amplitude scan with a typical range of 4 inches to 20 feet, and an analog range resolution as limited by a jitter of on the order of 0.01 inches. A differential sampling receiver is employed to effectively eliminate ringing and other aberrations induced in the receiver by the near proximity of the transmit antenna, so a background subtraction is not needed, simplifying the circuitry while improving performance. Uses of the invention include a replacement of ultrasound devices for fluid level sensing, automotive radar, such as cruise control and parking assistance, hidden object location, such as stud and rebar finding. In addition, this technology can be used when positioned over a highway lane to collect vehicle count and speed data for traffic control.

No. 6,191,724 to McEwan entitled: “Short Pulse Microwave Transceiver”, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. The implementation comprises a 24 GHz short-pulse transceiver comprised of a pulsed harmonic oscillator employed as a transmitter and an integrating, pulsed harmonic sampler employed as a receiver. The transmit oscillator generates a very short (0.5 ns) phase-coherent harmonic-rich oscillation at a sub-multiple of the actual transmitter frequency. A receiver local oscillator operates at a sub-multiple of the transmit frequency and is triggered with controlled timing to provide a very short (0.5 ns), phase-coherent local oscillator burst. The local oscillator burst is coupled to an integrating harmonic sampler to produce an integrated, equivalent-time replica of the received RF. The harmonic techniques overcome four major problems with non-harmonic approaches: 1) expensive, precision assembly, 2) high local oscillator noise, 3) sluggish oscillator startup, and 4) spurious local oscillator injection locking on external RF. The transceiver can be used for automotive backup and collision warning, precision radar rangefinding for fluid level sensing and robotics, precision radiolocation, wideband communications, and time-resolved holographic imaging.</div>

No. 6,535,161 to McEwan entitled: “Loop Powered Radar Rangefinder”, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. A key improvement over prior loop-powered pulse-echo radar is the use of carrier-based emissions rather than carrier-free ultrawideband impulses, which are prohibited by FCC regulations. The radar is based on a swept range-gate homodyne transceiver having a single RF transistor and a single antenna separated from the radar transceiver by a transmission line. The transmission line offers operational flexibility while imparting a reflection, or timing fiducial, at the antenna plane. Time-of-flight measurements are based on the time difference between a reflected fiducial pulse and an echo pulse, thereby eliminating accuracy-degrading propagation delays in the transmitters and receivers of prior radars. The loop-powered rangefinder further incorporates a current regulator for improved signaling accuracy, a simplified sensitivity-time-control (STC) based on a variable transconductance element, and a jam detector.

The Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) radio bands are radio bands (portions of the radio spectrum) reserved internationally for the use of radio frequency (RF) energy for industrial, scientific and medical purposes other than telecommunications. In general, communications equipment operating in these bands must tolerate any interference generated by ISM equipment, and users have no regulatory protection from ISM device operation. The ISM bands are defined by the ITU-R in 5.138, 5.150, and 5.280 of the Radio Regulations. Individual countries use of the bands designated in these sections may differ due to variations in national radio regulations. Because communication devices using the ISM bands must tolerate any interference from ISM equipment, unlicensed operations are typically permitted to use these bands, since unlicensed operation typically needs to be tolerant of interference from other devices anyway. The ISM bands share allocations with unlicensed and licensed operations; however, due to the high likelihood of harmful interference, licensed use of the bands is typically low. In the United States, uses of the ISM bands are governed by Part 18 of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules, while Part 15 contains the rules for unlicensed communication devices, even those that share ISM frequencies. In Europe, the ETSI is responsible for governing ISM bands.</div>

In order to determine the propagation time of the signal, a Time-Of-Flight (TOF) method may be used, where the time between the emission and reception of a light pulse is determined, the time measurement being effected with the aid of the edge, the peak value or some other characteristic of the pulse shape. In this case, pulse shape may be a temporal light intensity profile of the reception signal, specifically of the received light pulse—detected by the photosensitive element. The point in time of transmission can be determined either with the aid of an electrical pulse for initiating the emission, with the aid of the actuating signal applied to the transmitter, or with the aid of a reference signal mentioned above.</div>
    <div id="p-0138" num="0137" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">A pulsed Time-of-Flight (TOF) method is based on the phenomenon that the distance between two points can be determined by measuring the propagation time of a wave travelling between those two points. When used in an electro-optical based distance meter (such as the meter <b class="style-scope patent-text">22</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">b</i>), a pulse of light, usually emitted from a laser source (such as the laser diode <b class="style-scope patent-text">24</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">aa</i>) is transmitted to a target (such as the point <b class="style-scope patent-text">23</b> as part of the surface <b class="style-scope patent-text">28</b>), and a portion of the light pulse reflected from the target is collected at the source location (such as by the photo-diode <b class="style-scope patent-text">24</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">ba</i>). The round trip transit time of the light pulse (made of the lines <b class="style-scope patent-text">26</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a </i>and <b class="style-scope patent-text">26</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">b</i>) is measured, and the distance from the distance meter to the target is d=ct/2, where d is the distance, ‘c’ is the speed of light (in the propagation medium), T is the round trip transit time, and the factor of two accounts for the distance having to be traversed two times by the light pulse. The time measurement may be the time interval between a rising edge of the transmitted pulse and a rising edge of the reflected signal, between a trailing edge of the transmitted pulse and a trailing edge of the reflected signal, or any combination thereof. The speed of light, as well as the speed of sound, is a constant for a specific propagation medium. For example, the speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 300,000,000 meters per second, and in water, it is about ¾ of the speed in vacuum. Hence, assuming that a signal is travelling partly in air and partly in water (such as in a human body), the in-water and in-air travelled distance may be estimated based on the travel time.</div>

    <div id="p-0141" num="0140" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">There are variations on the basic pulse TOF architecture. For example, one type of architecture teaches how the capacitor voltage can be downward sloping as the capacitor is discharged with a constant current source between the start and stop pulses. Instead of generating a voltage ramp, another type of architecture describes how a high-speed digital counter can be continuously incremented with a high frequency clocking signal after the start pulse occurs, and then terminates when the stop pulse occurs. This eliminates the need for an A/D converter as the output of the counter is already in a digital format. However, this counter approach has quantization errors, which is remedied by random dithering or interpolation methods. The counter or pulse TOF methods can be used for coarse range estimates, while phase measuring TOF, discussed below, is used for more precise range estimates. Alternately, a series of N pulses could be transmitted, in which a subsequent pulse is transmitted after the previous one is received, and the total time for these N pulses to be sent and received is measured. Thereafter, the time is divided by N to obtain a more precise estimate of a round trip transit time. A pulse train of a predetermined timing sequence could be used. An electronic correlation function is used to compare the delayed transmit sequence to the received sequence, and when correlation is found the delay has the round trip transit time of the pulse sequence.</div>
    <div id="p-0142" num="0141" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">To obtain an accurate distance estimate, the pulses must either be extremely short, or as is usually the case, must have fast low-high and high-low transitions. To obtain accuracies approximately 0.1″, electronic bandwidths on the order of 1.0 gigahertz, or greater, are required in the transmission electronics, including the laser, as well as in the receive electronics, including the photodiode. Such broadband electronic components are expensive, and drive up the overall cost of the system. Furthermore, the distance signal processing is a two-stage affair. First, the distance information is encoded into a capacitor's voltage, and then secondly this voltage is converted into digital format for subsequent processing. A circuit that offers a single stage of processing is likely to be simpler, lower cost, and less error prone than a multi-stage system.</div>

    <div id="p-0145" num="0144" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Phase detection. In using a phase measuring principle, which the signal propagation time is determined by comparison of the phase angle of the amplitude modulation of the transmitted and received signals. In phase measuring rangefinding, a periodic modulation signal, usually a sinusoid, is transmitted to the target, and an echo is received and amplified. The phase of the received signal is delayed when compared to the phase of the transmitted signal because of the round trip transit time of the signal. A simplified schematic diagram of a phase measuring based correlator <b class="style-scope patent-text">29</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">b </i>is shown as part of the distance meter <b class="style-scope patent-text">22</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">c </i>in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS" class="style-scope patent-text">FIG. 2<i class="style-scope patent-text">c</i> </figref>. The emitter <b class="style-scope patent-text">24</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a </i>is fed with a sinewave generator <b class="style-scope patent-text">23</b>, so that the amplitude of the transmitted wave <b class="style-scope patent-text">26</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a </i>and the reflected (or backscattered) wave <b class="style-scope patent-text">29</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">ba </i>is sinewave modulated. A phase detector <b class="style-scope patent-text">29</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">bb </i>measure the phase difference between the transmitted and received signals, which is proportional to the time delay and thus to the measured distance. The phase difference between the two signals is directly proportional to the distance to the target, according to the expression d=φλ/4π, where d is the distance from the rangefinder to the target, and λ is the wavelength of the modulating sinusoid (e.g., is 15 meters for a 20 MHz signal), and φ is the phase difference in radians. A range ambiguity arises every λ/2 meters of distance, in which the phase of the modulating signal is identical every Nλ/2 meters. Since the modulation occurs in a continuous-wave fashion, the average power of the carrier must be high in order to be able to obtain a significant received signal for large target distances. Further, undesirable phase delay changes of the electronic circuitry with changes in ambient environmental conditions, especially temperature, may cause an error. In addition, gain changes in AGC (Automatic-Gain-Control) circuitry will cause changes in phase as well, and these changes cannot be reliably calibrated and subtracted out with commonly used on-board reference methods. The measurement result in the case of one transmission frequency may have ambiguities in units of the transmission frequency period duration, thus necessitating further measures for resolving these ambiguities. Two technologies are typically used in phase measuring based rangefinders, namely homodyne and heterodyne.</div>

    <div id="p-0147" num="0146" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Heterodyne. A heterodyne demodulator is one in which a high frequency signal is mixed with a signal of a different frequency, and the resulting signal has components of the sum and the difference of the two frequencies. Typically, the frequency difference between the two mixed signals is a constant known frequency, and the resulting higher frequency, corresponding to the sum of the frequencies, is usually ignored and removed through filtering. The lower frequency signal is amplified in a bandpass amplifier resulting in a signal that has a good signal to noise ratio owing to the fact that all out of band noise is filtered by the bandpass amplifier. This amplified signal is mixed yet again with another signal, this time having the same frequency, and low pass filtered, resulting in a low-noise DC component whose amplitude is proportional to the phase of the received signal. Alternately, if the target is moving, the DC signal will not be present, but instead a low frequency AC signal will be present, and the frequency of this signal is proportional to the velocity of the target because of the Doppler shift. A functional block diagram of a heterodyning phase-measuring rangefinder is shown and explained in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS" class="style-scope patent-text">FIG. 2</figref> and the associated description in U.S. Pat. No. 7,202,941.</div>
    <div id="p-0148" num="0147" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Homodyne. A similar demodulation method utilizes homodyne electronic processing, in which the received signal is mixed with a signal having the same frequency. This is different from the heterodyne system described above where the received signal is first mixed with a signal having a different frequency. The result of homodyne mixing is that the first mixing stage results directly in the phase or low frequency AC signal for distance or velocity estimation. The second heterodyne mixing is eliminated, meaning less electronic components are utilized which translates into a cost savings, but typically the SNR is somewhat poorer than heterodyne-based distance and velocity measurement. The homodyne phase measuring rangefinder has the same drawbacks of the heterodyning rangefinder, especially as related to nonlinearities within the electronic functions, particularly the phase splitter and the mixers, as well as the imprecision at distances proportional to nπ phase difference, and gain and delay drifts with changes in environmental conditions. Their mixer's outputs are also a function of the input signal amplitudes, and suffer from the same problems as discussed previously.</div>
    <div id="p-0149" num="0148" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Other phase measuring include a phase measuring distance-measuring system that uses light as the modulation carrier. A homodyne mixer can be used for electronic signal processing, while still incorporating an optical modulation carrier. Multiple modulation frequencies can be used to resolve the ambiguity problem and to improve the accuracy of the distance estimate. Heterodyne electronic signal processing methods can also be used in conjunction with two or more modulation frequencies.</div>
    <div id="p-0150" num="0149" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Coherent Burst. Coherent burst technology is a significant improvement over the phase measuring and pulse-TOF distance measuring methods. Specifically, the coherent burst modulation waveform allows the maximum range to be increased without compromising eye safety, and since the modulation is bandlimited, the resulting low cost circuitry and measurement accuracy is similar to that of the phase measuring methods. Coherent burst technology accomplishes this by combining the best of the phase-measuring and pulse-TOF methods, wherein a short series of bursts of amplitude modulated light is transmitted to the target. FIG. 4 in U.S. Pat. No. 7,202,941 illustrates the envelope of the coherent burst emission waveform, and FIG. 5 in U.S. Pat. No. 7,202,941 presents a magnified, and abbreviated, diagram of the coherent burst emission. The short bursts have pulse-like properties, in that they have a starting edge and a trailing edge, and a burst transmission can be used to start a counter or voltage ramp, and its reception from the target can be used to stop the counter or the voltage ramp, as described in the pulse TOF prior art discussion, above. This method can be used to provide a coarse estimate of the range, and therefore resolve the range ambiguity problem associated with phase measuring methods.</div>
    <div id="p-0151" num="0150" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The coherent burst, being a short duration burst of amplitude modulated light, will also work with phase measuring methods, if the electronics comprising these phase measuring methods can respond and settle within the duration of a burst. Increasing the amplitude modulation frequency of a burst allows for increased measurement accuracy. Furthermore, by spacing the coherent bursts in time, high burst powers can be realized while maintaining an eye-safe average power, and long distances can be measured. An illustrative functional diagram for a conventional embodiment of the coherent burst distance measuring method is presented in FIG. 3 in U.S. Pat. No. 7,202,941.</div>

A distance measurement by radar comprising a frequency modulated radar-transmitter and -receiver by which a radar beam is guided onto an object to be measured and which, by mixing of the transmitted frequency with the received frequency, delivers a beat signal; frequency modulating means, by which the transmitted frequency of the radar signal of the Doppler signal device is periodically variable in a saw-tooth shaped way and wherein the frequency of the beat signal, due to the travel time of the radar beam reflected by the object, is a measure for the distance of the object, and a signal processing circuit generating a measured value from the beat signal obtained. In the radar-transmitter and -receiver mixing takes place of the transmitted and the received signal. The signal received has passed the distance to and from the object, thereby has been transmitted at an earlier instant and thereby has, due to the saw-tooth modulation, a frequency, which is a bit different from the frequency of the signal, which is emitted at the moment of reception. Thereby a beat frequency occurs that is proportional to the travel time to the object and thereby to the distance from the object to the radar-transmitter and -receiver.</div>

    <div id="p-0160" num="0159" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">AC/DC Power Supply. A power supply is an electronic device that supplies electric energy to an electrical load, where the primary function of a power supply is to convert one form of electrical energy to another and, as a result, power supplies are sometimes referred to as electric power converters. Some power supplies are discrete, stand-alone devices, whereas others are built into larger devices along with their loads. Examples of the latter include power supplies found in desktop computers and consumer electronics devices. Every power supply must obtain the energy it supplies to its load, as well as any energy it consumes while performing that task, from an energy source. Depending on its design, a power supply may obtain energy from various types of energy sources, including electrical energy transmission systems, energy storage devices such as a batteries and fuel cells, electromechanical systems such as generators and alternators, solar power converters, or another power supply. All power supplies have a power input, which receives energy from the energy source, and a power output that delivers energy to the load. In most power supplies, the power input and the power output consist of electrical connectors or hardwired circuit connections, though some power supplies employ wireless energy transfer in lieu of galvanic connections for the power input or output.</div>
    <div id="p-0161" num="0160" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Some power supplies have other types of inputs and outputs as well, for functions such as external monitoring and control. Power supplies are categorized in various ways, including by functional features. For example, a regulated power supply is one that maintains constant output voltage or current despite variations in load current or input voltage. Conversely, the output of an unregulated power supply can change significantly when its input voltage or load current changes. Adjustable power supplies allow the output voltage or current to be programmed by mechanical controls (e.g., knobs on the power supply front panel), or by means of a control input, or both. An adjustable regulated power supply is one that is both adjustable and regulated. An isolated power supply has a power output that is electrically independent of its power input; this is in contrast to other power supplies that share a common connection between power input and output.</div>
    <div id="p-0162" num="0161" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">AC-to-DC (AC/DC) power supply uses AC mains electricity as an energy source, and typically employs a transformer to convert the input voltage to a higher, or commonly lower AC voltage. A rectifier is used to convert the transformer output voltage to a varying DC voltage, which in turn is passed through an electronic filter to convert it to an unregulated DC voltage. The filter removes most, but not all of the AC voltage variations; the remaining voltage variations are known as a ripple. The electric load tolerance of ripple dictates the minimum amount of filtering that must be provided by a power supply. In some applications, high ripple is tolerated and therefore no filtering is required. For example, in some battery charging applications, it is possible to implement a mains-powered DC power supply with nothing more than a transformer and a single rectifier diode, with a resistor in series with the output to limit charging current.</div>
    <div id="p-0163" num="0162" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The function of a linear voltage regulator is to convert a varying AC or DC voltage to a constant, often specific, lower DC voltage. In addition, they often provide a current limiting function to protect the power supply and load from overcurrent (excessive, potentially destructive current). A constant output voltage is required in many power supply applications, but the voltage provided by many energy sources will vary with changes in load impedance. Furthermore, when an unregulated DC power supply is the energy source, its output voltage will also vary with changing input voltage. To circumvent this, some power supplies use a linear voltage regulator to maintain the output voltage at a steady value, independent of fluctuations in input voltage and load impedance. Linear regulators can also reduce the magnitude of ripple and noise present appearing on the output voltage.</div>
    <div id="p-0164" num="0163" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In a Switched-Mode Power Supply (SMPS), the AC mains input is directly rectified and then filtered to obtain a DC voltage, which is then switched “on” and “off” at a high frequency by electronic switching circuitry, thus producing an AC current that will pass through a high-frequency transformer or inductor. Switching occurs at a very high frequency (typically 10 kHz-1 MHz), thereby enabling the use of transformers and filter capacitors that are much smaller, lighter, and less expensive than those found in linear power supplies operating at mains frequency. After the inductor or transformer secondary, the high frequency AC is rectified and filtered to produce the DC output voltage. If the SMPS uses an adequately insulated high-frequency transformer, the output will be electrically isolated from the mains; this feature is often essential for safety. Switched-mode power supplies are usually regulated, and to keep the output voltage constant, the power supply employs a feedback controller that monitors current drawn by the load. SMPSs often include safety features such as current limiting or a crowbar circuit to help protect the device and the user from harm. In the event that an abnormally high-current power draw is detected, the switched-mode supply can assume this is a direct short and will shut itself down before damage is done. PC power supplies often provide a power good signal to the motherboard; the absence of this signal prevents operation when abnormal supply voltages are present.</div>

A battery may be a primary battery or cell, in which an irreversible chemical reaction generates the electricity, and thus the cell is disposable and cannot be recharged, and need to be replaced after the battery is drained. Such battery replacement may be expensive and cumbersome. Alternatively or in addition, a rechargeable (secondary) battery may be used, such as a nickel-cadmium based battery. In such a case, a battery charger is employed for charging the battery while it is in use or not in use. Various types of such battery chargers are known in the art, such as trickle chargers, pulse chargers and the like. The battery charger may be integrated with the field unit or be external to it. The battery may be a primary or a rechargeable (secondary) type, may include a single or few batteries, and may use various chemicals for the electro-chemical cells, such as lithium, alkaline and nickel-cadmium. Common batteries are manufactured in pre-defined standard output voltages (1.5, 3, 4.5, 9 Volts, for example), as well as defined standard mechanical enclosures (usually defined by letters such as “A”, “AA”, “B”, “C” sizes), and ‘coin’ or ‘button’ type.

Most button cells have low self-discharge and hold their charge for a long time if not used. Higher-power devices such as hearing aids may use zinc-air cells that have much higher capacity for a given size, but discharge over a few weeks even if not used. Button cells are single cells, usually disposable primary cells. Common anode materials are zinc or lithium, and common cathode materials are manganese dioxide, silver oxide, carbon monofluoride, cupric oxide or oxygen from the air. A metal can forms the bottom body and positive terminal of the cell, where the insulated top cap is the negative terminal.</div>

    <div id="p-0170" num="0169" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Wireless networking typically employs an antenna (a.k.a. aerial), which is an electrical device that converts electric power into radio waves, and vice versa, connected to a wireless radio transceiver. In transmission, a radio transmitter supplies an electric current oscillating at radio frequency to the antenna terminals, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as electromagnetic waves (radio waves). In reception, an antenna intercepts some of the power of an electromagnetic wave in order to produce a low voltage at its terminals that is applied to a receiver to be amplified. Typically an antenna consists of an arrangement of metallic conductors (elements), electrically connected (often through a transmission line) to the receiver or transmitter. An oscillating current of electrons forced through the antenna by a transmitter will create an oscillating magnetic field around the antenna elements, while the charge of the electrons also creates an oscillating electric field along the elements. These time-varying fields radiate away from the antenna into space as a moving transverse electromagnetic field wave. Conversely, during reception, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of an incoming radio wave exert force on the electrons in the antenna elements, causing them to move back and forth, creating oscillating currents in the antenna. Antennas can be designed to transmit and receive radio waves in all horizontal directions equally (omnidirectional antennas), or preferentially in a particular direction (directional or high gain antennas). In the latter case, an antenna may also include additional elements or surfaces with no electrical connection to the transmitter or receiver, such as parasitic elements, parabolic reflectors or horns, which serve to direct the radio waves into a beam or other desired radiation pattern.</div>

LPD433 (Low Power Device 433 MHz) is a UHF band in which license-free communication devices are allowed to operate in Europe and other countries over the world. The frequencies correspond with the ITU region 1 ISM band of 433.050 MHz to 434.790 MHz, and operation is mainly limited to CEPT countries. The frequencies used are within the 70-centimeter band, which is traditionally reserved for higher power amateur radio operations in most nations worldwide. LPD hand-held radios are authorized for license-free voice communications used in most of Europe using analog frequency modulation (FM) as part of short-range device regulations, with 25 kHz channel spacing, for a total of 69 channels. In some countries, LPD devices may only be used with the integral and non-removable antenna with a maximum legal power output of 10 mW. LPD433 is also commonly used by wireless instruments and digital devices such as car keylocks.</div>
    <div id="p-0172" num="0171" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Zigbee. ZigBee is a standard for a suite of high-level communication protocols using small, low-power digital radios based on an IEEE 802 standard for Personal Area Network (PAN). Applications include wireless light switches, electrical meters with in-home displays, and other consumer and industrial equipment that require a short-range wireless transfer of data at relatively low rates. The technology defined by the ZigBee specification is intended to be simpler and less expensive than other WPANs, such as Bluetooth. ZigBee is targeted at Radio-Frequency (RF) applications that require a low data rate, long battery life, and secure networking. ZigBee has a defined rate of 250 kbps suited for periodic or intermittent data or a single signal transmission from a sensor or input device.</div>
    <div id="p-0173" num="0172" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">ZigBee builds upon the physical layer and medium access control defined in IEEE standard 802.15.4 (2003 version) for low-rate WPANs. The specification further discloses four main components: network layer, application layer, ZigBee Device Objects (ZDOs), and manufacturer-defined application objects, which allow for customization and favor total integration. The ZDOs are responsible for a number of tasks, which include keeping of device roles, management of requests to join a network, device discovery, and security. Because ZigBee nodes can go from a sleep to active mode in 30 ms or less, the latency can be low and devices can be responsive, particularly compared to Bluetooth wake-up delays, which are typically around three seconds. ZigBee nodes can sleep most of the time, thus an average power consumption can be lower, resulting in longer battery life.</div>
    <div id="p-0174" num="0173" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">There are three defined types of ZigBee devices: ZigBee Coordinator (ZC), ZigBee Router (ZR), and ZigBee End Device (ZED). ZigBee Coordinator (ZC) is the most capable device, forms the root of the network tree, and might bridge to other networks. There is exactly one defined ZigBee coordinator in each network, and it is the device that started the network originally. It is able to store information about the network, including acting as the Trust Center &amp; repository for security keys. ZigBee Router (ZR) may be running an application function as well as can acting as an intermediate router, passing on data from other devices. ZigBee End Device (ZED) contains functionality to talk to a parent node (either the coordinator or a router). This relationship allows the node to be asleep a significant amount of the time, thereby giving long battery life. A ZED requires the least amount of memory, and therefore can be less expensive to manufacture than a ZR or ZC.</div>
    <div id="p-0175" num="0174" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The protocols build on recent algorithmic research (Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector, neuRFon) to automatically construct a low-speed ad-hoc network of nodes. In most large network instances, the network will be a cluster of clusters. It can also form a mesh or a single cluster. The current ZigBee protocols support beacon and non-beacon enabled networks. In non-beacon-enabled networks, an unslotted CSMA/CA channel access mechanism is used. In this type of network, ZigBee Routers typically have their receivers continuously active, requiring a more robust power supply. However, this allows for heterogeneous networks in which some devices receive continuously, while others only transmit when an external stimulus is detected.</div>
    <div id="p-0176" num="0175" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In beacon-enabled networks, the special network nodes called ZigBee Routers transmit periodic beacons to confirm their presence to other network nodes. Nodes may sleep between the beacons, thus lowering their duty cycle and extending their battery life. Beacon intervals depend on the data rate; they may range from 15.36 milliseconds to 251.65824 seconds at 250 Kbit/s, from 24 milliseconds to 393.216 seconds at 40 Kbit/s, and from 48 milliseconds to 786.432 seconds at 20 Kbit/s. In general, the ZigBee protocols minimize the time the radio is on to reduce power consumption. In beaconing networks, nodes only need to be active while a beacon is being transmitted. In non-beacon-enabled networks, power consumption is decidedly asymmetrical: some devices are always active, while others spend most of their time sleeping.</div>
    <div id="p-0177" num="0176" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Except for the Smart Energy Profile 2.0, current ZigBee devices conform to the IEEE 802.15.4-2003 Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Network (LR-WPAN) standard. The standard specifies the lower protocol layers—the PHYsical layer (PHY), and the Media Access Control (MAC) portion of the Data Link Layer (DLL). The basic channel access mode is “Carrier Sense, Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance” (CSMA/CA), that is, the nodes talk in the same way that people converse; they briefly check to see that no one is talking before they start. There are three notable exceptions to the use of CSMA. Beacons are sent on a fixed time schedule, and do not use CSMA. Message acknowledgments also do not use CSMA. Finally, devices in Beacon Oriented networks that have low latency real-time requirements may also use Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS), which by definition do not use CSMA.</div>

The Z-wave radio specifications include bandwidth of 9,600 bit/s or 40 Kbit/s, fully interoperable, GFSK modulation, and a range of approximately 100 feet (or 30 meters) assuming “open air” conditions, with reduced range indoors depending on building materials, etc. The Z-Wave radio uses the 900 MHz ISM band: 908.42 MHz (United States); 868.42 MHz (Europe); 919.82 MHz (Hong Kong); and 921.42 MHz (Australia/New Zealand).</div>
    <div id="p-0180" num="0179" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Z-Wave uses a source-routed mesh network topology and has one or more master controllers that control routing and security. The devices can communicate to another by using intermediate nodes to actively route around, and circumvent household obstacles or radio dead spots that might occur. A message from node A to node C can be successfully delivered even if the two nodes are not within range, providing that a third node B can communicate with nodes A and C. If the preferred route is unavailable, the message originator will attempt other routes until a path is found to the “C” node. Therefore, a Z-Wave network can span much farther than the radio range of a single unit; however, with several of these hops, a delay may be introduced between the control command and the desired result. In order for Z-Wave units to be able to route unsolicited messages, they cannot be in sleep mode. Therefore, most battery-operated devices are not designed as repeater units. A Z-Wave network can consist of up to 232 devices with the option of bridging networks if more devices are required.</div>

    <div id="p-0182" num="0181" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">WLAN. Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), is a popular wireless technology that makes use of the Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) frequency spectrum. In the US, three of the bands within the ISM spectrum are the A band, 902-928 MHz; the B band, 2.4-2.484 GHz (a.k.a. 2.4 GHz); and the C band, 5.725-5.875 GHz (a.k.a. 5 GHz). Overlapping and/or similar bands are used in different regions such as Europe and Japan. In order to allow interoperability between equipment manufactured by different vendors, few WLAN standards have evolved, as part of the IEEE 802.11 standard group, branded as WiFi (www.wi-fi.org). IEEE 802.11b describes a communication using the 2.4 GHz frequency band and supporting communication rate of 11 Mb/s, IEEE 802.11a uses the 5 GHz frequency band to carry 54 MB/s and IEEE 802.11g uses the 2.4 GHz band to support 54 Mb/s. The WiFi technology is further described in a publication entitled: “WiFi Technology” by Telecom Regulatory Authority, published on July 2003, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. The IEEE 802 defines an ad-hoc connection between two or more devices without using a wireless access point: the devices communicate directly when in range. An ad hoc network offers peer-to-peer layout and is commonly used in situations such as a quick data exchange or a multiplayer LAN game, because the setup is easy and an access point is not required.</div>
    <div id="p-0183" num="0182" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">A node/client with a WLAN interface is commonly referred to as STA (Wireless Station/Wireless client). The STA functionality may be embedded as part of the data unit, or alternatively be a dedicated unit, referred to as bridge, coupled to the data unit. While STAs may communicate without any additional hardware (ad-hoc mode), such network usually involves Wireless Access Point (a.k.a. WAP or AP) as a mediation device. The WAP implements the Basic Stations Set (BSS) and/or ad-hoc mode based on Independent BSS (IBSS). STA, client, bridge and WAP will be collectively referred to hereon as WLAN unit. Bandwidth allocation for IEEE 802.11g wireless in the U.S. allows multiple communication sessions to take place simultaneously, where eleven overlapping channels are defined spaced 5 MHz apart, spanning from 2412 MHz as the center frequency for channel number 1, via channel 2 centered at 2417 MHz and 2457 MHz as the center frequency for channel number 10, up to channel 11 centered at 2462 MHz. Each channel bandwidth is 22 MHz, symmetrically (+/−11 MHz) located around the center frequency. In the transmission path, first the baseband signal (IF) is generated based on the data to be transmitted, using 256 QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) based OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) modulation technique, resulting a 22 MHz (single channel wide) frequency band signal. The signal is then up converted to the 2.4 GHz (RF) and placed in the center frequency of required channel, and transmitted to the air via the antenna. Similarly, the receiving path comprises a received channel in the RF spectrum, down converted to the baseband (IF) wherein the data is then extracted.</div>
    <div id="p-0184" num="0183" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In order to support multiple devices and using a permanent solution, a Wireless Access Point (WAP) is typically used. A Wireless Access Point (WAP, or Access Point—AP) is a device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi, or related standards. The WAP usually connects to a router (via a wired network) as a standalone device, but can also be an integral component of the router itself. Using Wireless Access Point (AP) allows users to add devices that access the network with little or no cables. A WAP normally connects directly to a wired Ethernet connection, and the AP then provides wireless connections using radio frequency links for other devices to utilize that wired connection. Most APs support the connection of multiple wireless devices to one wired connection. Wireless access typically involves special security considerations, since any device within a range of the WAP can attach to the network. The most common solution is wireless traffic encryption. Modern access points come with built-in encryption such as Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), typically used with a password or a passphrase. Authentication in general, and a WAP authentication in particular, is used as the basis for authorization, which determines whether a privilege may be granted to a particular user or process, privacy, which keeps information from becoming known to non-participants, and non-repudiation, which is the inability to deny having done something that was authorized to be done based on the authentication. An authentication in general, and a WAP authentication in particular, may use an authentication server, that provides a network service that applications may use to authenticate the credentials, usually account names and passwords of their users. When a client submits a valid set of credentials, it receives a cryptographic ticket that it can subsequently be used to access various services. Authentication algorithms include passwords, Kerberos, and public key encryption.</div>

Spread spectrum technologies, to include both DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum) and FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum) are known in the art. Spread spectrum commonly employs Multi-Carrier Modulation (MCM) such as OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing). OFDM and other spread spectrum are commonly used in wireless communication systems, particularly in WLAN networks.</div>

    <div id="p-0187" num="0186" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Bluetooth. Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances (using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the ISM band from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz) from fixed and mobile devices, and building personal area networks (PANs). It can connect several devices, overcoming problems of synchronization. A Personal Area Network (PAN) may be according to, compatible with, or based on, Bluetooth™ or IEEE 802.15.1-2005 standard. A Bluetooth controlled electrical appliance is described in U.S. Patent Application No. 2014/0159877 to Huang entitled: “Bluetooth Controllable Electrical Appliance”, and an electric power supply is described in U.S. Patent Application No. 2014/0070613 to Garb et al. entitled: “Electric Power Supply and Related Methods”, which are both incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</div>
    <div id="p-0188" num="0187" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Bluetooth operates at frequencies between 2402 and 2480 MHz, or 2400 and 2483.5 MHz including guard bands 2 MHz wide at the bottom end and 3.5 MHz wide at the top. This is in the globally unlicensed (but not unregulated) Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) 2.4 GHz short-range radio frequency band. Bluetooth uses a radio technology called frequency-hopping spread spectrum. Bluetooth divides transmitted data into packets, and transmits each packet on one of 79 designated Bluetooth channels. Each channel has a bandwidth of 1 MHz. It usually performs 800 hops per second, with Adaptive Frequency-Hopping (AFH) enabled. Bluetooth low energy uses 2 MHz spacing, which accommodates 40 channels. Bluetooth is a packet-based protocol with a master-slave structure. One master may communicate with up to seven slaves in a piconet. All devices share the master's clock. Packet exchange is based on the basic clock, defined by the master, which ticks at 312.5 μs intervals. Two clock ticks make up a slot of 625 μs, and two slots make up a slot pair of 1250 μs. In the simple case of single-slot packets, the master transmits in even slots and receives in odd slots. The slave, conversely, receives in even slots and transmits in odd slots. Packets may be 1, 3 or 5 slots long, but in all cases the master's transmission begins in even slots and the slave's in odd slots.</div>
    <div id="p-0189" num="0188" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">A master Bluetooth device can communicate with a maximum of seven devices in a piconet (an ad-hoc computer network using Bluetooth technology), though not all devices reach this maximum. The devices can switch roles, by agreement, and the slave can become the master (for example, a headset initiating a connection to a phone necessarily begins as master—as initiator of the connection—but may subsequently operate as slave). The Bluetooth Core Specification provides for the connection of two or more piconets to form a scatternet, in which certain devices simultaneously play the master role in one piconet and the slave role in another. At any given time, data can be transferred between the master and one other device (except for the little-used broadcast mode). The master chooses which slave device to address; typically, it switches rapidly from one device to another in a round-robin fashion. Since it is the master that chooses which slave to address, whereas a slave is supposed to listen in each receive slot, being a master is a lighter burden than being a slave. Being a master of seven slaves is possible; being a slave of more than one master is difficult.</div>
    <div id="p-0190" num="0189" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Bluetooth Low Energy. Bluetooth low energy (Bluetooth LE, BLE, marketed as Bluetooth Smart) is a wireless personal area network technology designed and marketed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) aimed at novel applications in the healthcare, fitness, beacons, security, and home entertainment industries. Compared to Classic Bluetooth, Bluetooth Smart is intended to provide considerably reduced power consumption and cost while maintaining a similar communication range. Bluetooth low energy is described in a Bluetooth SIG published Dec. 2, 2014 standard Covered Core Package version: 4.2, entitled: “<i class="style-scope patent-text">Master Table of Contents </i>&amp;<i class="style-scope patent-text">Compliance Requirements—Specification Volume </i>0”, and in an article published 2012 in Sensors [ISSN 1424-8220] by Carles Gomez et al.

    <div id="p-0191" num="0190" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Bluetooth Smart technology operates in the same spectrum range (the 2.400 GHz-2.4835 GHz ISM band) as Classic Bluetooth technology, but uses a different set of channels. Instead of the Classic Bluetooth 79 1-MHz channels, Bluetooth Smart has 40 2-MHz channels. Within a channel, data is transmitted using Gaussian frequency shift modulation, similar to Classic Bluetooth's Basic Rate scheme. The bit rate is 1 Mbit/s, and the maximum transmit power is 10 mW. Bluetooth Smart uses frequency hopping to counteract narrowband interference problems. Classic Bluetooth also uses frequency hopping but the details are different; as a result, while both FCC and ETSI classify Bluetooth technology as an FHSS scheme, Bluetooth Smart is classified as a system using digital modulation techniques or a direct-sequence spread spectrum. All Bluetooth Smart devices use the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT). The application programming interface offered by a Bluetooth Smart aware operating system will typically be based around GATT concepts.</div>
    <div id="p-0192" num="0191" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">BLE provides proximity sensing, where the relevant application profiles include FMP—the “find me” profile, that allows one device to issue an alert on a second misplaced device, and PXP—the proximity profile, that allows a proximity monitor to detect whether a proximity reporter is within a close range. Physical proximity can be estimated using the radio receiver's RSSI value, although this does not have absolute calibration of distances. Typically, an alarm may be sounded when the distance between the devices exceeds a set threshold.</div>

Any wireless communication herein may be partly or in full in accordance with, compatible with, or based on, short-range communication such as Near Field Communication (NFC), having a theoretical working distance of 20 centimeters and a practical working distance of about 4 centimeters, and commonly used with mobile devices, such as smartphones. The NFC typically operates at 13.56 MHz as defined in IS O/IEC 18000-3 air interface, and at data rates ranging from 106 Kbit/s to 424 Kbit/s. NFC commonly involves an initiator and a target; the initiator actively generates an RF field that may power a passive target. NFC peer-to-peer communication is possible, provided both devices are powered.</div>
    <div id="p-0194" num="0193" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The NFC typically supports passive and active modes of operation. In passive communication mode, the initiator device provides a carrier field and the target device answers by modulating the existing field, and the target device may draw its operating power from the initiator-provided electromagnetic field, thus making the target device a transponder. In active communication mode, both devices typically have power supplies, and both initiator and target devices communicate by alternately generating their own fields, where a device deactivates its RF field while it is waiting for data. NFC typically uses Amplitude-Shift Keying (ASK), and employs two different schemes to transfer data. At the data transfer rate of 106 Kbit/s, a modified Miller coding with 100% modulation is used, while in all other cases Manchester coding is used with a modulation ratio of 10%.</div>

    <div id="p-0197" num="0196" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Signal strength. In telecommunications, particularly in radio frequency, signal strength (also referred to as field strength) refers to the transmitter power output as received by a reference antenna at a distance from the transmitting antenna. High-powered transmissions, such as those used in broadcasting, are expressed in dB-millivolts per meter (dBmV/m). For very low-power systems, such as mobile phones, signal strength is usually expressed in dB-microvolts per meter (dBμV/m) or in decibels above a reference level of one milliwatt (dBm). In broadcasting terminology, 1 mV/m is 1000 μV/m or 60 dBμ (often written dBu).</div>
    <div id="p-0198" num="0197" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">RSSI. A Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is a measurement of the power present in a received radio signal. RSSI is usually invisible to a user of a receiving device. However, because signal strength can vary greatly and affect functionality in wireless networking, IEEE 802.11 devices often make the measurement available to users. RSSI is often done in the Intermediate Frequency (IF) stage before the IF amplifier. In zero-IF systems, it is done in the baseband signal chain, before the baseband amplifier. RSSI output is often a DC analog level, and it can also be sampled by an internal ADC and the resulting codes available directly or via peripheral or internal processor bus. RSSI is described in an Application Note published February 2004 by MaxStream, Inc.

    <div id="p-0200" num="0199" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Motion sensor. A motion sensor may include one or more accelerometers, which measures the absolute acceleration or the acceleration relative to freefall. For example, one single-axis accelerometer per axis may be used, requiring three such accelerometers for three-axis sensing. The motion sensor may be a single or multi-axis sensor, detecting the magnitude and direction of the acceleration as a vector quantity, and thus can be used to sense orientation, acceleration, vibration, shock and falling. The motion sensor output may be analog or digital signals, representing the measured values. The motion sensor may be based on a piezoelectric accelerometer that utilizes the piezoelectric effect of certain materials to measure dynamic changes in mechanical variables (e.g., acceleration, vibration, and mechanical shock). Piezoelectric accelerometers commonly rely on piezoceramics (e.g., lead zirconate titanate) or single crystals (e.g., Quartz, Tourmaline). A piezoelectric quartz accelerometer is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,716,985 to Zhang et al. entitled: “Piezoelectric Quartz Accelerometer”, U.S. Pat.

    <div id="p-0202" num="0201" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">IMU. The Inertial Measurement Unity (IMU) is an integrated sensor package that combines multiple accelerometers and gyros to produce a three dimensional measurement of both specific force and angular rate, with respect to an inertial reference frame, as for example the Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) reference frame. Specific force is a measure of acceleration relative to free-fall. Subtracting the gravitational acceleration results in a measurement of actual coordinate acceleration. Angular rate is a measure of rate of rotation. Typically, IMU includes the combination of only a 3-axis accelerometer combined with a 3-axis gyro. An onboard processor, memory, and temperature sensor may be included to provide a digital interface, unit conversion and to apply a sensor calibration model. An IMU may include one or more motion sensors.</div>
    <div id="p-0203" num="0202" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) further measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body, using a combination of accelerometers and gyroscopes, sometimes also magnetometers. IMUs are typically used to maneuver aircraft, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), among many others, and spacecraft, including satellites and landers. The IMU is the main component of inertial navigation systems used in aircraft, spacecraft, watercraft, drones, UAV and guided missiles among others. In this capacity, the data collected from the IMU's sensors allows a computer to track a craft's position, using a method known as dead reckoning.</div>
    <div id="p-0204" num="0203" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">An inertial measurement unit works by detecting the current rate of acceleration using one or more accelerometers, and detects changes in rotational attributes like pitch, roll and yaw using one or more gyroscopes. Typical IMU also includes a magnetometer, mostly to assist calibration against orientation drift. Inertial navigation systems contain IMUs that have angular and linear accelerometers (for changes in position); some IMUs include a gyroscopic element (for maintaining an absolute angular reference). Angular accelerometers measure how the vehicle is rotating in space. Generally, there is at least one sensor for each of the three axes: pitch (nose up and down), yaw (nose left and right) and roll (clockwise or counter-clockwise from the cockpit). Linear accelerometers measure non-gravitational accelerations of the vehicle. Since it can move in three axes (up &amp; down, left &amp; right, forward &amp; back), there is a linear accelerometer for each axis. The three gyroscopes are commonly placed in a similar orthogonal pattern, measuring rotational position in reference to an arbitrarily chosen coordinate system. A computer continually calculates the vehicle's current position. First, for each of the six degrees of freedom (x,y,z and Ox, Oy, and Oz), it integrates over time the sensed acceleration, together with an estimate of gravity, to calculate the current velocity. Then it integrates the velocity to calculate the current position.</div>

    <div id="p-0206" num="0205" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Phase detection. In using a phase measuring principle, which the signal propagation time is determined by comparison of the phase angle of the amplitude modulation of the transmitted and received signals. In phase measuring rangefinding, a periodic modulation signal, usually a sinusoidal wave, is transmitted to the target, and an echo is received and amplified. The phase of the received signal is delayed when compared to the phase of the transmitted signal because of the round trip transit time of the signal. A simplified schematic diagram of a phase measuring based correlator <b class="style-scope patent-text">19</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">b </i>is shown as part of the distance meter <b class="style-scope patent-text">15</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">b </i>in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS" class="style-scope patent-text">FIG. 2<i class="style-scope patent-text">a</i> </figref>. The emitter <b class="style-scope patent-text">11</b> is fed with a sinewave generator <b class="style-scope patent-text">23</b>, so that the amplitude of the transmitted wave <b class="style-scope patent-text">26</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a </i>and the reflected (or backscattered) wave <b class="style-scope patent-text">26</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">b </i>is sinewave modulated. A phase detector <b class="style-scope patent-text">24</b> measure the phase difference between the transmitted and received signals, which is proportional to the time delay and thus to the measured distance. The phase difference between the two signals is directly proportional to the distance to the target, according to the expression d=φλ/4π, where d is the distance from the rangefinder to the target, and λ is the wavelength of the modulating sinusoid (e.g., is 15 meters for a 20 MHz signal), and φ is the phase difference in radians. A range ambiguity arises every λ/2 meters of distance, in which the phase of the modulating signal is identical every Nλ/2 meters. Since the modulation occurs in a continuous-wave fashion, the average power of the carrier must be high in order to be able to obtain a significant received signal for large target distances. Further, undesirable phase delay changes of the electronic circuitry with changes in ambient environmental conditions, especially temperature, may cause an error. In addition, gain changes in AGC (Automatic-Gain-Control) circuitry will cause changes in phase as well, and these changes cannot be reliably calibrated and subtracted out with commonly used on-board reference methods. The measurement result in the case of one transmission frequency may have ambiguities in units of the transmission frequency period duration, thus necessitating further measures for resolving these ambiguities. Two technologies are typically used in phase measuring based rangefinders, namely homodyne and heterodyne.</div>

No. 6,040,898 to Mrosik et al. entitled: “FMCW Distance Measurement Process”, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. In an FMCW distance measurement process, a wave train of carrier frequency f0 is modulated with a time function f(t) and subdivided into a transmission signal and into a reference signal in deterministic phase relationship with the transmission signal; the transmission signal is sent on a transmission section to be measured and the reference signal is supplied to a phase difference-forming arrangement; the signal reflected in the transmission section with a delay that corresponds to propagation time τ is also supplied as a reception signal to the phase difference-forming arrangement that forms the time difference function θ(t) between the phases of reference and reception signals; the phase difference function θ(t) is separately evaluated in a continuous fraction θ=that corresponds to the carrier frequency f0 and in an alternating fraction θ−(t) that corresponds to the modulation time function f(t); and the propagation time τ proportional to the distance is finally determined by evaluating together both phase difference information.</div>

A distance measurement by radar comprising a frequency modulated radar-transmitter and -receiver by which a radar beam is guided onto an object to be measured and which, by mixing of the transmitted frequency with the received frequency, delivers a beat signal; frequency modulating means, by which the transmitted frequency of the radar signal of the Doppler signal device is periodically variable in a saw-tooth shaped way and wherein the frequency of the beat signal, due to the travel time of the radar beam reflected by the object, is a measure for the distance of the object, and a signal processing circuit generating a measured value from the beat signal obtained. In the radar-transmitter and -receiver mixing takes place of the transmitted and the received signal. The signal received has passed the distance to and from the object, thereby has been transmitted at an earlier instant and thereby has, due to the saw-tooth modulation, a frequency, which is a bit different from the frequency of the signal, which is emitted at the moment of reception. Thereby a beat frequency occurs that is proportional to the travel time to the object and thereby to the distance from the object to the radar-transmitter and -receiver.</div>
    <div id="p-0212" num="0211" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Phase detector. A phase detector (or phase comparator) is a frequency mixer, analog multiplier or logic circuit that generates a voltage signal, which represents the difference in phase between two signal inputs. It is an essential element of the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL). Phase detection may use an analog or digital phase detector. They typically produce an output that is proportional to the phase difference between the two signals. When the phase difference between the two incoming signals is steady, they produce a constant voltage. When there is a frequency difference between the two signals, they produce a varying voltage. The difference frequency product is the one used to give the phase difference. An example of a digital/analog phase detector is Phase Detector Model ADF4002 available from Analog Devices, Inc. (headquartered in Norwood, Mass., U.S.A.) and is described in an 2015 data sheet Rev. D (D06052-0-9/15(D)) entitled: “<i class="style-scope patent-text">Phase Detector/frequency Synthesizer—ADF</i>4002”, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</div>
    <div id="p-0213" num="0212" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The analog phase detector needs to compute the phase difference of its two input signals. Let α be the phase of the first input and β be the phase of the second. The actual input signals to the phase detector, however, are not α and β, but rather sinusoids such as sin(α) and cos(β). In general, computing the phase difference would involve computing the arcsine and arccosine of each normalized input (to get an ever-increasing phase) and doing a subtraction. A simple form of an analog phase detector is diode ring mixer phase-detector and it can be synthesized from a diode ring mixer. The diode ring phase detector is a simple and effective form of phase detector that can be implemented using a standard diode ring module. An example of an analog phase detector is Phase Detector Model AD8302 available from Analog Devices, Inc. (headquartered in Norwood, Mass., U.S.A.) and is described in an 2002 data sheet Rev. A entitled: “<i class="style-scope patent-text">LF</i>-2.7 <i class="style-scope patent-text">GHz</i>-<i class="style-scope patent-text">RF/IF Gain and Phase Detector—AD</i>8302”, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</div>
    <div id="p-0214" num="0213" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">A digital phase detector suitable for square wave signals can be made from an exclusive-OR (XOR) logic gate. When the two signals being compared are completely in-phase, the XOR gate's output will have a constant level of zero. When the two signals differ in phase by 1°, the XOR gate's output will be high for 1/180th of each cycle—the fraction of a cycle during which the two signals differ in value. When the signals differ by 180°—that is, one signal is high when the other is low, and vice versa—the XOR gate output remains high throughout each cycle. The XOR detector compares well to the analog mixer in that it locks near a 90° phase difference and has a square-wave output at twice the reference frequency. The square-wave changes duty-cycle in proportion to the phase difference resulting. Applying the XOR gate's output to a low-pass filter results in an analog voltage that is proportional to the phase difference between the two signals. It requires inputs that are symmetrical square waves, or nearly so. The remainder of its characteristics are very similar to the analog mixer for capture range, lock time, reference spurious, and low-pass filter requirements. Digital phase detectors can also be based on a sample and hold circuit, a charge pump, or a logic circuit consisting of flip-flops. When a phase detector that is based on logic gates is used in a PLL, it can quickly force the VCO to synchronize with an input signal, even when the frequency of the input signal differs substantially from the initial frequency of the VCO. XOR-based phase detection is described in an article published in Advanced Computing: An International Journal (ACIJ), Vol. 2, No. 6, November 2011, by Delvadiya Harikrushna et al. entitled: “<i class="style-scope patent-text">Design, Implementation, and Charactrization of XOR Phase Detector for DPLL in </i>45 <i class="style-scope patent-text">nm CMOS Technology</i>”, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</div>
    <div id="p-0215" num="0214" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">A phase-frequency detector is an asynchronous sequential logic circuit originally made of four flip-flops (i.e., the phase-frequency detectors found in both the RCA CD4046 and the Motorola MC4344 ICs introduced in the 1970s). The logic determines which of the two signals has a zero-crossing earlier or more often. When used in a PLL application, lock can be achieved even when it is off frequency and is known as a Phase Frequency Detector. Such a detector has the advantage of producing an output even when the two signals being compared differ not only in phase but also in frequency. A phase frequency detector prevents a “false lock” condition in PLL applications, in which the PLL synchronizes with the wrong phase of the input signal or with the wrong frequency (e.g., a harmonic of the input signal). A bang-bang charge pump phase detector supplies current pulses with fixed total charge, either positive or negative, to the capacitor acting as an integrator. A phase detector for a bang-bang charge pump must always have a dead band where the phases of inputs are close enough that the detector fires either both or neither of the charge pumps, for no total effect. Bang-bang phase detectors are simple, but are associated with significant minimum peak-to-peak jitter, because of drift within the dead band.</div>
    <div id="p-0216" num="0215" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">A proportional phase detector employs a charge pump that supplies charge amounts in proportion to the phase error detected. Some have dead bands and some do not. Specifically, some designs produce both “up” and “down” control pulses even when the phase difference is zero. These pulses are small, nominally the same duration, and cause the charge pump to produce equal-charge positive and negative current pulses when the phase is perfectly matched. Phase detectors with this kind of control system do not exhibit a dead band and typically have lower minimum peak-to-peak jitter when used in PLLs. In PLL applications, it is frequently required to know when the loop is out of lock. The more complex digital phase-frequency detectors usually have an output that allows a reliable indication of an out of lock condition.</div>

A mobile phone (also known as a cellular phone, cell phone, smartphone, or hand phone) is a device which can make and receive telephone calls over a radio link whilst moving around a wide geographic area, by connecting to a cellular network provided by a mobile network operator. The calls are to and from the public telephone network, which includes other mobiles and fixed-line phones across the world. The Smartphones are typically hand-held and may combine the functions of a personal digital assistant (PDA), and may serve as portable media players and camera phones with high-resolution touch-screens, web browsers that can access, and properly display, standard web pages rather than just mobile-optimized sites, GPS navigation, Wi-Fi and mobile broadband access. In addition to telephony, the Smartphones may support a wide variety of other services such as text messaging, MMS, email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications (infrared, Bluetooth), business applications, gaming and photography.</div>

    <div id="p-0219" num="0218" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">A mobile operating system (also referred to as mobile OS), is an operating system that operates a smartphone, tablet, PDA, or another mobile device. Modern mobile operating systems combine the features of a personal computer operating system with other features, including a touchscreen, cellular, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS mobile navigation, camera, video camera, speech recognition, voice recorder, music player, near field communication and infrared blaster. Currently popular mobile OSs are Android, Symbian, Apple iOS, BlackBerry, MeeGo, Windows Phone, and Bada. Mobile devices with mobile communications capabilities (e.g. smartphones) typically contain two mobile operating systems—a main user-facing software platform is supplemented by a second low-level proprietary real-time operating system that operates the radio and other hardware.</div>
    <div id="p-0220" num="0219" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Android is an open source and Linux-based mobile operating system (OS) based on the Linux kernel that is currently offered by Google. With a user interface based on direct manipulation, Android is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, with specialized user interfaces for televisions (Android TV), cars (Android Auto), and wrist watches (Android Wear). The OS uses touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, such as swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, and a virtual keyboard. Despite being primarily designed for touchscreen input, it also has been used in game consoles, digital cameras, and other electronics. The response to user input is designed to be immediate and provides a fluid touch interface, often using the vibration capabilities of the device to provide haptic feedback to the user. Internal hardware such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and proximity sensors are used by some applications to respond to additional user actions, for example adjusting the screen from portrait to landscape depending on how the device is oriented, or allowing the user to steer a vehicle in a racing game by rotating the device by simulating control of a steering wheel.</div>

A homescreen may be made up of several pages that the user can swipe back and forth between, though Android's homescreen interface is heavily customizable, allowing the user to adjust the look and feel of the device to their tastes. Third-party apps available on Google Play and other app stores can extensively re-theme the homescreen, and even mimic the look of other operating systems, such as Windows Phone.

    <div id="p-0223" num="0222" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Vehicle. A vehicle is a mobile machine that transports people or cargo. Most often, vehicles are manufactured, such as wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats), aircraft and spacecraft. The vehicle may be designed for use on land, on or in fluids, or be airborne, such as bicycle, car, automobile, motorcycle, train, ship, boat, submarine, airplane, scooter, bus, subway, train, or spacecraft. A vehicle may be a bicycle, a car, a motorcycle, a train, a ship, an aircraft, a boat, a spacecraft, a boat, a submarine, a dirigible, an electric scooter, a subway, a train, a trolleybus, a tram, a sailboat, a yacht, or an airplane. Further, a vehicle may be a bicycle, a car, a motorcycle, a train, a ship, an aircraft, a boat, a spacecraft, a boat, a submarine, a dirigible, an electric scooter, a subway, a train, a trolleybus, a tram, a sailboat, a yacht, or an airplane.</div>
    <div id="p-0224" num="0223" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">A vehicle may be a land vehicle typically moving on the ground, using wheels, tracks, rails, or skies. The vehicle may be locomotion-based where the vehicle is towed by another vehicle or an animal. Propellers (as well as screws, fans, nozzles, or rotors) are used to move on or through a fluid or air, such as in watercrafts and aircrafts. The system described herein may be used to control, monitor or otherwise be part of, or communicate with, the vehicle motion system. Similarly, the system described herein may be used to control, monitor or otherwise be part of, or communicate with, the vehicle steering system. Commonly, wheeled vehicles steer by angling their front or rear (or both) wheels, while ships, boats, submarines, dirigibles, airplanes and other vehicles moving in or on fluid or air usually have a rudder for steering. The vehicle may be an automobile, defined as a wheeled passenger vehicle that carries its own motor, and primarily designed to run on roads, and have seating for one to six people. Typically, automobiles have four wheels, and are constructed to principally transport of people.</div>
    <div id="p-0225" num="0224" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Human power may be used as a source of energy for the vehicle, such as in non-motorized bicycles. Further, energy may be extracted from the surrounding environment, such as solar powered car or aircraft, a street car, as well as by sailboats and land yachts using the wind energy. Alternatively or in addition, the vehicle may include energy storage, and the energy is converted to generate the vehicle motion. A common type of energy source is a fuel, and external or internal combustion engines are used to burn the fuel (such as gasoline, diesel, or ethanol) and create a pressure that is converted to a motion. Another common medium for storing energy are batteries or fuel cells, which store chemical energy used to power an electric motor, such as in motor vehicles, electric bicycles, electric scooters, small boats, subways, trains, trolleybuses, and trams.</div>
    <div id="p-0226" num="0225" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Aircraft. An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. The human activity that surrounds aircraft is called aviation. Crewed aircraft are flown by an onboard pilot, but unmanned aerial vehicles may be remotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard computers. Aircraft may be classified by different criteria, such as lift type, aircraft propulsion, usage and others.</div>
    <div id="p-0227" num="0226" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Aerostats are lighter than air aircrafts use buoyancy to float in the air in much the same way that ships float on the water. They are characterized by one or more large gasbags or canopies, filled with a relatively low-density gas such as helium, hydrogen, or hot air, which is less dense than the surrounding air. When the weight of this is added to the weight of the aircraft structure, it adds up to the same weight as the air that the craft displaces. Heavier-than-air aircraft, such as airplanes, must find some way to push air or gas downwards, so that a reaction occurs (by Newton's laws of motion) to push the aircraft upwards. This dynamic movement through the air is the origin of the term aerodyne. There are two ways to produce dynamic upthrust: aerodynamic lift, and powered lift in the form of engine thrust.</div>
    <div id="p-0228" num="0227" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Aerodynamic lift involving wings is the most common, with fixed-wing aircraft being kept in the air by the forward movement of wings, and rotorcraft by spinning wing-shaped rotors sometimes called rotary wings. A wing is a flat, horizontal surface, usually shaped in cross-section as an aerofoil. To fly, air must flow over the wing and generate lift. A flexible wing is a wing made of fabric or thin sheet material, often stretched over a rigid frame. A kite is tethered to the ground and relies on the speed of the wind over its wings, which may be flexible or rigid, fixed, or rotary.</div>
    <div id="p-0229" num="0228" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Gliders are heavier-than-air aircraft that do not employ propulsion once airborne. Take-off may be by launching forward and downward from a high location, or by pulling into the air on a tow-line, either by a ground-based winch or vehicle, or by a powered “tug” aircraft. For a glider to maintain its forward air speed and lift, it must descend in relation to the air (but not necessarily in relation to the ground). Many gliders can ‘soar’—gain height from updrafts such as thermal currents. Common examples of gliders are sailplanes, hang gliders and paragliders. Powered aircraft have one or more onboard sources of mechanical power, typically aircraft engines although rubber and manpower have also been used. Most aircraft engines are either lightweight piston engines or gas turbines. Engine fuel is stored in tanks, usually in the wings but larger aircraft also have additional fuel tanks in the fuselage.</div>
    <div id="p-0230" num="0229" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">A propeller aircraft use one or more propellers (airscrews) to create thrust in a forward direction. The propeller is usually mounted in front of the power source in tractor configuration but can be mounted behind in pusher configuration. Variations of propeller layout include contra-rotating propellers and ducted fans. A Jet aircraft use airbreathing jet engines, which take in air, burn fuel with it in a combustion chamber, and accelerate the exhaust rearwards to provide thrust. Turbojet and turbofan engines use a spinning turbine to drive one or more fans, which provide additional thrust. An afterburner may be used to inject extra fuel into the hot exhaust, especially on military “fast jets”. Use of a turbine is not absolutely necessary: other designs include the pulse jet and ramjet. These mechanically simple designs cannot work when stationary, so the aircraft must be launched to flying speed by some other method. Some rotorcraft, such as helicopters, have a powered rotary wing or rotor, where the rotor disc can be angled slightly forward so that a proportion of its lift is directed forwards. The rotor may, like a propeller, be powered by a variety of methods such as a piston engine or turbine. Experiments have also used jet nozzles at the rotor blade tips.</div>
    <div id="p-0231" num="0230" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">A vehicle may include a hood (a.k.a. bonnet), which is the hinged cover over the engine of motor vehicles that allows access to the engine compartment (or trunk on rear-engine and some mid-engine vehicles) for maintenance and repair. A vehicle may include a bumper, which is a structure attached, or integrated to, the front and rear of an automobile to absorb impact in a minor collision, ideally minimizing repair costs. Bumpers also have two safety functions: minimizing height mismatches between vehicles, and protecting pedestrians from injury. A vehicle may include a cowling, which is the covering of a vehicle's engine, most often found on automobiles and aircraft. A vehicle may include a dashboard (also called dash, instrument panel, or fascia), which is a control panel placed in front of the driver of an automobile, housing instrumentation and controls for operation of the vehicle. A vehicle may include a fender that frames a wheel well (the fender underside). Its primary purpose is to prevent sand, mud, rocks, liquids, and other road spray from being thrown into the air by the rotating tire. Fenders are typically rigid and can be damaged by contact with the road surface. Instead, flexible mud flaps are used close to the ground where contact may be possible. A vehicle may include a quarter panel (a.k.a. rear wing), which is the body panel (exterior surface) of an automobile between a rear door (or only door on each side for two-door models) and the trunk (boot) and typically wraps around the wheel well. Quarter panels are typically made of sheet metal, but are sometimes made of fiberglass, carbon fiber, or fiber-reinforced plastic. A vehicle may include a rocker, which is the body section below the base of the door openings. A vehicle may include a spoiler, which is an automotive aerodynamic device whose intended design function is to ‘spoil’ unfavorable air movement across a body of a vehicle in motion, usually described as turbulence or drag. Spoilers on the front of a vehicle are often called air dams. Spoilers are often fitted to race and high-performance sports cars, although they have become common on passenger vehicles as well. Some spoilers are added to cars primarily for styling purposes and have either little aerodynamic benefit or even make the aerodynamics worse. The trunk (a.k.a. boot) of a car is the vehicle's main storage compartment. A vehicle door is a type of door, typically hinged, but sometimes attached by other mechanisms such as tracks, in front of an opening, which is used for entering and exiting a vehicle. A vehicle door can be opened to provide access to the opening, or closed to secure it. These doors can be opened manually, or powered electronically. Powered doors are usually found on minivans, high-end cars, or modified cars. Car glass includes windscreens, side and rear windows, and glass panel roofs on a vehicle. Side windows can be either fixed or be raised and lowered by depressing a button (power window) or switch or using a hand-turned crank.</div>
    <div id="p-0232" num="0231" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The lighting system of a motor vehicle consists of lighting and signaling devices mounted or integrated to the front, rear, sides, and in some cases the top of a motor vehicle. This lights the roadway for the driver and increases the conspicuity of the vehicle, allowing other drivers and pedestrians to see a vehicle's presence, position, size, direction of travel, and the driver's intentions regarding direction and speed of travel. Emergency vehicles usually carry distinctive lighting equipment to warn drivers and indicate priority of movement in traffic. A headlamp is a lamp attached to the front of a vehicle to light the road ahead. A chassis consists of an internal framework that supports a manmade object in its construction and use. An example of a chassis is the underpart of a motor vehicle, consisting of the frame (on which the body is mounted).</div>

Automotive electronics commonly involves multiple modular ECUs (Electronic Control Unit) connected over a network. Such as Engine Control Modules (ECM) or Transmission Control Modules (TCM). Automotive electronics or automotive embedded systems are distributed systems, and according to different domains in the automotive field, they can be classified into Engine electronics, Transmission electronics, Chassis electronics, Active safety, Driver assistance, Passenger comfort, and Entertainment (or infotainment) systems.</div>
    <div id="p-0234" num="0233" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">One of the most demanding electronic parts of an automobile is the Engine Control Unit. Engine controls demand one of the highest real time deadlines, as the engine itself is a very fast and complex part of the automobile. The computing power of the engine control unit is commonly the highest, typically a 32-bit processor, that typically controls in real-time in a diesel engine the Fuel injection rate, Emission control, NOx control, Regeneration of oxidation catalytic converter, Turbocharger control, Throttle control, and Cooling system control. In a gasoline engine the engine control typically involves Lambda control, OBD (On-Board Diagnostics), Cooling system control, Ignition system control, Lubrication system control, Fuel injection rate control, and Throttle control.</div>
    <div id="p-0235" num="0234" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">An engine ECU typically connects to, or includes, sensors that actively monitor in real-time engine parameters such as pressure, temperature, flow, engine speed, oxygen level and NOx level, plus other parameters at different points within the engine. All these sensor signals are analyzed by the ECU, which has the logic circuits to do the actual controlling. The ECU output is commonly connected to different actuators for the throttle valve, EGR valve, rack (in VGTs), fuel injector (using a pulse-width modulated signal), dosing injector and more.</div>
    <div id="p-0236" num="0235" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Transmission electronics involves control of the transmission system, mainly the shifting of the gears for better shift comfort and to lower torque interrupt while shifting. Automatic transmissions use controls for their operation, and many semi-automatic transmissions having a fully automatic clutch or a semi-auto clutch (declutching only). The engine control unit and the transmission control typically exchange messages, sensor signals and control signals for their operation. Chassis electronics typically includes many sub-systems that monitor various parameters and are actively controlled, such as ABS—Anti-lock Braking System, TCS—Traction Control System, EBD—Electronic Brake Distribution, and ESP—Electronic Stability Program. Active safety systems involve modules that are ready-to-act when there is a collision in progress, or used to prevent it when it senses a dangerous situation, such as Air bags, Hill descent control, and Emergency brake assist system. Passenger comfort systems involve, for example, Automatic climate control, Electronic seat adjustment with memory, Automatic wipers, Automatic headlamps—adjusts beam automatically, and Automatic cooling—temperature adjustment. Infotainment systems include systems such as Navigation system, Vehicle audio, and Information access.</div>

    <div id="p-0238" num="0237" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">ADAS. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, or ADAS, are automotive electronic systems to help the driver in the driving process, such as to increase car safety and more generally road safety using a safe Human-Machine Interface. Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are developed to automate/adapt/enhance vehicle systems for safety and better driving. Safety features are designed to avoid collisions and accidents by offering technologies that alert the driver to potential problems, or to avoid collisions by implementing safeguards and taking over control of the vehicle. Adaptive features may automate lighting, provide adaptive cruise control, automate braking, incorporate GPS/traffic warnings, connect to smartphones, alert driver to other cars or dangers, keep the driver in the correct lane, or show what is in blind spots.</div>
    <div id="p-0239" num="0238" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">There are many forms of ADAS available; some features are built into cars or are available as an add-on package.

    <div id="p-0241" num="0240" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">EOR (Eyes-off-The-Road). Various naturalistic driving studies have shown that a driver's allocation of visual attention away from the road is a critical indicator of accident risk. Such work would suggest that a real-time estimation of driver's gaze could be coupled with an alerting system to enhance safety when the driver is overly distracted or inattentive. High precision eye tracking that includes an estimate of pupil orientation in the vehicle is costly and difficult. From an image processing perspective alone, difficulties involve the unpredictability of the environment, presence of sunglasses occluding the eye, rapid changes in ambient lighting including situations of extreme glare resulting from reflection, partial occlusion of the pupil due to squinting, vehicle vibration, and image blur.</div>
    <div id="p-0242" num="0241" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Vehicles having the ability to monitor an operator of a vehicle and detect that the operator is not paying attention to the road scene allow for measures to prevent a vehicle collision due to the operator not paying attention. For instance, warning systems can be enabled to alert the driver that he or she is not paying attention. Further, automatic braking and automatic steering systems can be enabled to bring the vehicle to a stop if it is determined that the driver has not become attentive even after being warned. It is known to utilize driver-monitoring camera devices configured to monitor a driver and detect an Eyes-Off-the-Road (EOR) condition indicating that the driver's eyes are not on the road. However, real-time gaze tracking that includes a combination of head pose and eye gaze direction is challenging in the vehicular environment due to (1) different height and facial features of drivers making it difficult to calibrate a camera device for the head pose and gaze direction, (2) unknown illumination conditions leading to unreliable detection of the facial features and (3) abrupt changes in the driver's head pose being difficult to track in video streams contained in image data captured by the camera device.</div>
    <div id="p-0243" num="0242" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">For example, some vehicle systems use the gaze direction of a driver to determine if the driver is inattentive to road and to generate warning signals to the driver. In another example, some vehicle systems determine that the driver is looking in the direction of a particular control knob or switch of the vehicle and can control that particular element (e.g., turn it on, etc.) based on the determination. In each of the examples, the vehicle systems make a general determination of where the driver is looking and do not make a determination of what the driver is looking at (i.e. what is grasping the attention of the driver).</div>
    <div id="p-0244" num="0243" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Examples of various EOR systems are described in an article Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) published 1 Mar. 2016 [arXiv:1507.04760v2 [cs.CV] 1 Mar. 2016] by Lex Fridman, Philipp Langhans, Joonbum Lee, and Bryan Reimer entitled: “<i class="style-scope patent-text">Driver Gaze Region Estimation Without Using Eye Movement</i>”, in an Elsevier Science Ltd. 2002 published paper in Real-Time Imaging 8, 357-377 (2002) [doi:10.1006/rtim.2002.0279] by Qiang Ji and Xiaojie Yang entitled: “<i class="style-scope patent-text">Real</i>-<i class="style-scope patent-text">Time Eye, Gaze, and Face Pose Tracking for Monitoring Driver Vigilance</i>”, and in a paper presented in 2004 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (Parma, Italy June 14-17,2004) by Luis M.

    <div id="p-0247" num="0246" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">iBeacon. iBeacon is a protocol developed by Apple Inc, and supported by various vendors iBeacon-compatible hardware transmitters—typically called beacons—a class of Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) devices that broadcast their identifier to nearby portable electronic devices. The technology enables smartphones, tablets and other devices to perform actions when in close proximity to an iBeacon. iBeacon uses Bluetooth low energy proximity sensing to transmit a universally unique identifier picked up by a compatible app or operating system. The identifier and several bytes sent with it can be used to determine the device's physical location, track customers, or trigger a location-based action on the device such as a check-in on social media or a push notification. One application is distributing messages at a specific Point of Interest, for example a store, a bus stop, a room or a more specific location like a piece of furniture or a vending machine. This is similar to previously used geopush technology based on GPS, but with a much reduced impact on battery life and much extended precision.</div>
    <div id="p-0248" num="0247" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Another application is an indoor positioning system, which helps smartphones determine their approximate location or context. With the help of an iBeacon, a smartphone's software can approximately find its relative location to an iBeacon in a store. Brick and mortar retail stores use the beacons for mobile commerce, offering customers special deals through mobile marketing, and can enable mobile payments through point of sale systems. iBeacon differs from some other location-based technologies as the broadcasting device (beacon) is only a 1-way transmitter to the receiving smartphone or receiving device, and necessitates a specific app installed on the device to interact with the beacons. This ensures that only the installed app (not the iBeacon transmitter) can track users, potentially against their will, as they passively walk around the transmitters. iBeacon compatible transmitters come in a variety of form factors, including small coin cell devices, USB sticks, and generic Bluetooth 4.0 capable USB dongles.</div>
    <div id="p-0249" num="0248" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">An iBeacon deployment consists of one or more iBeacon devices that transmit their own unique identification number to the local area. Software on a receiving device may then look up the iBeacon and perform various functions, such as notifying the user. Receiving devices can also connect to the iBeacons to retrieve values from iBeacon's GATT (generic attribute profile) service. iBeacons do not push notifications to receiving devices (other than their own identity). However, mobile software can use signals received from iBeacons to trigger their own push notifications. Region monitoring is limited to 20 regions and can function in the background (of the listening device) and has different delegates to notify the listening app (and user) of entry/exit in the region—even if the app is in the background or the phone is locked. Region monitoring also allows for a small window in which iOS gives a closed app an opportunity to react to the entry of a region.</div>
    <div id="p-0250" num="0249" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">As opposed to monitoring, which enables users to detect movement in-and-out of range of the beacons, ranging provides a list of beacons detected in a given region, along with the estimated distance from the user's device to each beacon. Ranging works only in the foreground but will return (to the listening device) an array (unlimited) of all iBeacons found along with their properties (UUID, etc.). An iOS device receiving an iBeacon transmission can approximate the distance from the iBeacon. The distance (between transmitting iBeacon and receiving device) is categorized into 3 distinct ranges: Immediate: Within a few centimeters, Near: Within a couple of meters, and Far: Greater than 10 meters away, An iBeacon broadcast has the ability to approximate when a user has entered, exited, or lingered in region. Depending on a customer's proximity to a beacon, they are able to receive different levels of interaction at each of these three ranges. The maximum range of an iBeacon transmission will depend on the location and placement, obstructions in the environment and where the device is being stored (e.g. in a leather handbag or with a thick case). Standard beacons have an approximate range of 70 meters. Long range beacons can reach up to 450 meters.</div>
    <div id="p-0251" num="0250" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The frequency of the iBeacon transmission depends on the configuration of the iBeacon and can be altered using device specific methods. Both the rate and the transmit power have an effect on the iBeacon battery life. iBeacons come with predefined settings and several of them can be changed by the developer. Amongst others the rate and the transmit power can be changed as well as the Major and Minor values. The Major and Minor values are settings which can be used to connect to specific iBeacons or to work with more than one iBeacon at the same time. Typically, multiple iBeacon deployment at a venue will share the same UUID, and use the major and minor pairs to segment and distinguish subspaces within the venue. For example, the Major values of all the iBeacons in a specific store can be set to the same value and the Minor value can be used to identify a specific iBeacon within the store. Bluetooth low energy devices can operate in an advertisement mode to notify nearby devices of their presence. At the most simple form, an iBeacon is a Bluetooth low energy device emitting advertisement following a strict format, that being an Apple defined iBeacon prefix, followed by a variable UUID, and a major, minor pair.</div>

    <div id="p-0253" num="0252" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Wearables. As used herein, the term “wearable device” (or “wearable”) includes a body-borne device (or item) designed or intended to be worn by a human. Such devices are typically comfortably worn on, and are carried or transported by, the human body, and are commonly used to create constant, convenient, seamless, portable, and mostly hands-free access to electronics and computers. The wearable devices may be in direct contact with the human body (such as by touching, or attaching to, the body skin), or may be releasably attachable to clothes or other items intended or designed to be worn on the human body. In general, the goal of wearable technologies is to smoothly incorporate functional, portable electronics and computers into individuals' daily lives. Wearable devices may be releasably attached to the human body using attaching means such as straps, buckles, belts, or clasps. Alternatively or in addition, wearable devices may be shaped, structured, or having a form factor to be body releasably mountable or attachable, such as using eye-glass frames or headphones.

The amount of energy stored, and hence the field intensities in these environments depend on the nature of electromagnetic absorption by the human body, so quantifying human absorption at these frequencies is necessary for accurate modelling of both electromagnetic interference and communications path loss in such situations.</div>

In this study, the absorption cross section of the human body is plotted and its behavior is compared to several biometric parameters, of which the body's surface area is found to have a dominant effect on absorption. The results are normalized out to provide an absorption efficiency of the skin, which is again compared to several biometric parameters; the strongest correlation is found to be with an estimate for average thickness of the subcutaneous fat layer.

    <div id="p-0272" num="0271" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In an experiment, a smartphone wirelessly streaming music was used, serving as a constant and continuous Bluetooth signal generator, wireless coupled to a Plantronics® Bluetooth headset model “Voyager Edge” as a receiver. An RF signal meter (model ED88T from Cornet® Micro Systems Inc.) was used to measure the received signal strength. A bottle of water approximately 10 cm in diameter was used as RF signal absorber. Without the bottle, or with an empty bottle, the signal received by the signal meter was measured to be at 40 mW/m<sup class="style-scope patent-text">2</sup>. With the bottle filled with water, where the signal penetrated 10 cm of water, the signal strength was approximately 0.11 mW/m<sup class="style-scope patent-text">2</sup>. Thus, the signal was attenuated to 0.275% of the original signal strength, fitting a prediction for 10 cm of water.</div>
    <div id="p-0273" num="0272" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Empirical results of microwave absorption in humans provide an attenuation of −20 dB (±2 dB) at 800 MHz, −28 dB (±2 dB) at 900 MHz, −28 dB (±2 dB) at 1.0 GHz, −29 dB (±2 dB) at 1.1 GHz, −31 dB (±2 dB) at 1.2 GHz, −38 dB (±2 dB) at 1.3 GHz, −43 dB (±2 dB) at 1.4 GHz, and −47 dB (±2 dB) at 1.5 GHz. This data points may be best fitted by an empirical formula where the loss (in dB) for 30 cm average thickness of human body is given by: Loss(dB)=(28±2)*[Frequency]<sup class="style-scope patent-text">1.2</sup>, where the Loss is in dB, and the Frequency is in GHz. As the speed of electromagnetic waves is proportional to the reciprocal value of the square root of the dielectric constant, the resulting wavelength in a human tissue can drop to a fraction of the wavelength in air; e.g. at 10 GHz the wavelength can drop from 3 cm to about 3.4 mm. When considering phase shift of a signal, it is noted that the signal phase changes upon the signal passing inside a medium having specific dielectric properties and then through a medium having a different dielectric properties (such as a signal flowing through a human body and then outside the human body).</div>
    <div id="p-0274" num="0273" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Using human body RF absorption. One of the simplest ways to achieve meter-level accuracy in specific zones is by a proximity measurement. The measurement of distance using received signal strength is very accurate when within a meter or so of a transmitter because the signal strength decreases as the inverse square of the distance to the source, and there are rarely any signal obstructions. It is therefore easy to detect close proximity to a BLE device, and hence confidently trigger a location-based event. If we were to assume a modest measurement noise such as 3 dBm, this would result in a ranging uncertainty of the same order of magnitude as the distance to the source; within a meter of the transmitter a positioning uncertainty of only a few centimeters would be possible, however, at 10 m the ranging error would be around 5 m.</div>
    <div id="p-0275" num="0274" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Using BLE for indoor positioning is described in an article by R. Faragher and R. Harle (both from University of Cambridge, UK) published in the Proceedings of the 27th International Technical Meeting of The Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation (ION GNSS+2014), [Tampa, Fla., September 2014, pp. 201-210] entitled: “<i class="style-scope patent-text">An Analysis of the Accuracy of Bluetooth Low Energy for Indoor Positioning Applications</i>”, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. The human body also attenuates 2.4 GHz radio signals, further complicating the range estimation. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS" class="style-scope patent-text">FIG. 1</figref> shows the output from a short set of static tests moving away from a BLE beacon in an open environment. The experiment demonstrates that a ˜10 dB reduction in RSS caused by this body effect will still result in a reasonable proximity measurement when within 10 cm of the transmitter (the receiver will still be estimated to be within a meter of the transmitter), whereas out at 1 meter the body effect can result in a range estimate of 5-10 meters. However, the ranging performance rapidly drops off with range, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS" class="style-scope patent-text">FIG. 1</figref>. At approximately 1 meter from source, the BLE signal strength is −58 dBm if obstructed by a human body, and −44 dBm if remain unobstructed.</div>
    <div id="p-0276" num="0275" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Direction finding. Direction finding (DF), or radio direction finding (RDF), is the measurement of the direction from which a received signal was transmitted. This can refer to radio or other forms of wireless communication, including radar signals detection and monitoring (ELINT/ESM). By combining the direction information from two or more suitably spaced receivers (or a single mobile receiver), the source of a transmission may be located via triangulation. RDF systems can be used with any radio source, although very long wavelengths (low frequencies) require very large antennas, and are generally used only on ground-based systems. These wavelengths are nevertheless used for marine radio navigation as they can travel very long distances “over the horizon”, which is valuable for ships when the line-of-sight may be only a few tens of kilometers. For aerial use, where the horizon may extend to hundreds of kilometers, higher frequencies can be used, allowing the use of much smaller antennas.</div>
    <div id="p-0277" num="0276" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The three main techniques used in passive direction finding (DF) are Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA), amplitude comparison, and phase interferometry. All three methods of DF measure differences in the signals received at two or more separated antennas. The TDOA method measures the difference in arrival time of one signal at multiple antennas to calculate the Angle of Arrival (AoA) and range of the emitter. The degree of accuracy of the TDOA method depends on the distance between the antennas. The amplitude comparison method uses two directional antennas pointed in different directions that the ratio of the gains for the two antennas will be unique for each angle within the field of view. By comparing the amplitude ratio of the signals received by the two antennas to known gain patterns.</div>

    <div id="p-0428" num="0427" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The principles and operation of an apparatus or a method according to the present invention may be understood with reference to the figures and the accompanying description wherein identical or similar components (either hardware or software) appearing in different figures are denoted by identical reference numerals. The drawings and descriptions are conceptual only. In actual practice, a single component can implement one or more functions; alternatively or in addition, each function can be implemented by a plurality of components and devices. In the figures and descriptions, identical reference numerals indicate those components that are common to different embodiments or configurations. Identical numerical references (in some cases, even in the case of using different suffix, such as <b class="style-scope patent-text">5</b>, <b class="style-scope patent-text">5</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a</i>, <b class="style-scope patent-text">5</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">b </i>and <b class="style-scope patent-text">5</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">c</i>) refer to functions or actual devices that are either identical, substantially similar, similar, or having similar functionality. It is readily understood that the components of the present invention, as generally described and illustrated in the figures herein, could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the apparatus, system, and method of the present invention, as represented in the figures herein, is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, as claimed, but is merely representative of embodiments of the invention. It is to be understood that the singular forms “a”, “an”, and “the” herein include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, a reference to “a component surface” includes a reference to one or more of such surfaces. By the term “substantially” it is meant that the recited characteristic, parameter, feature, or value need not be achieved exactly, but that deviations or variations, including, for example, tolerances, measurement error, measurement accuracy limitations and other factors known to those of skill in the art, may occur in amounts that do not preclude the effect the characteristic was intended to provide.</div>
    <div id="p-0429" num="0428" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">All directional references used herein (e.g., upper, lower, upwards, downwards, left, right, leftward, rightward, top, bottom, above, below, vertical, horizontal, clockwise, and counterclockwise, etc.) are only used for identification purposes to aid the reader's understanding of the present invention, and do not create limitations, particularly as to the position, orientation, or use of the invention. Spatially relative terms, such as “inner,” “outer,” “beneath”, “below”, “right”, “left”, “upper”, “lower”, “above”, “front”, “rear”, “left”, “right” and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. Spatially relative terms may be intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as “below” or “beneath” other elements or features would then be oriented “above” the other elements or features. Thus, the example term “below” can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</div>
    <div id="p-0430" num="0429" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Traditional operation of a digital camera involves looking at the digital camera viewfinder (such as the display <b class="style-scope patent-text">38</b>) and pushing a ‘shutter’ button (such as the button <b class="style-scope patent-text">38</b>). Such two activities in parallel require full attention of the user, and reduces the user ability to attend to other activities or to enjoy in full the scene or image that is being captured by the camera. Hence, an automatic image capturing by a digital camera that obviates the need for looking at the viewfinder of a digital camera or the need to push any buttons therein eases the camera operation and improves the uses experience. Further, most digital cameras are portable and powered by a battery, while the display <b class="style-scope patent-text">38</b>, serving as the viewfinder, commonly consumes a large portion of the total digital camera power consumption. Thus reducing the need to activate the display <b class="style-scope patent-text">38</b> allows for lower power consumption, and provides increased period of using the battery before the need arises to replace the battery (in case of primary battery) or to recharge the battery (in case of rechargeable battery). Furthermore, the physical size of the digital camera <b class="style-scope patent-text">30</b> is substantially affected by the display <b class="style-scope patent-text">38</b>, and obviating the need for such viewfinder may allow for a much smaller size digital camera. In addition, obviating the need for the display <b class="style-scope patent-text">38</b> may allow for a reduced complexity and associated costs of a digital camera.</div>
    <div id="p-0431" num="0430" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In one example, the head pose of a person, which commonly corresponds to the person gaze direction, is measured or estimated using two wearable devices, serving as RF beacons, worn on the right and left sides of the person.

The person head <b class="style-scope patent-text">43</b> pose is in along the line-of-sight direction denoted by a dashed line <b class="style-scope patent-text">44</b>, approximated to initiate from the point in the middle of the person eyes. The improved digital camera <b class="style-scope patent-text">45</b> is located relative to the head <b class="style-scope patent-text">43</b> along the line-of-sight <b class="style-scope patent-text">46</b>, forming a deviation angle α <b class="style-scope patent-text">49</b> with the head <b class="style-scope patent-text">43</b> pose (gaze) direction line <b class="style-scope patent-text">44</b>. The LWEAR device <b class="style-scope patent-text">50</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a </i>comprises an antenna <b class="style-scope patent-text">47</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a </i>(denoted by a black filled circle) that transmits an RF signal propagating along a line <b class="style-scope patent-text">42</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a</i>. Similarly, the RWEAR device <b class="style-scope patent-text">50</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">b </i>comprises an antenna <b class="style-scope patent-text">47</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">b </i>(denoted by a black filled circle) that transmits an RF signal propagating along a line <b class="style-scope patent-text">42</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">b</i>. The improved digital camera <b class="style-scope patent-text">45</b> received both RF signals along lines <b class="style-scope patent-text">42</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a </i>and <b class="style-scope patent-text">42</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">b</i>, respectively from the LWEAR device <b class="style-scope patent-text">50</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a </i>and the RWEAR device <b class="style-scope patent-text">50</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">b</i>, and by analyzing the signals, such as by comparing the two signal, estimates the deviation angle α <b class="style-scope patent-text">49</b>. In one scenario, shown as an arrangement <b class="style-scope patent-text">40</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a </i>in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS" class="style-scope patent-text">FIG. 4<i class="style-scope patent-text">a</i> </figref>, the person is looking directly at the improved camera <b class="style-scope patent-text">45</b>, hence the person line-of-sight <b class="style-scope patent-text">44</b> aligns with the direction to the camera <b class="style-scope patent-text">45</b> line <b class="style-scope patent-text">44</b>, resulting in the deviation angle α <b class="style-scope patent-text">49</b> having a zero value.

    <div id="p-0434" num="0433" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">A controller <b class="style-scope patent-text">55</b>, located within the XWEAR device <b class="style-scope patent-text">50</b>, controls and monitors the device operation, such as initialization, configuration, interface, and commands. The controller <b class="style-scope patent-text">55</b> may be based on a discrete logic or an integrated device, such as a processor, microprocessor or microcomputer, and may include a general-purpose device or may be a special purpose-processing device, such as an ASIC, PAL, PLA, PLD, Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Gate Array, or other customized or programmable device. In the case of a programmable device as well as in other implementations, a memory is required. The controller <b class="style-scope patent-text">55</b> commonly includes a memory that may include a static RAM (random Access Memory), dynamic RAM, flash memory, ROM (Read Only Memory), or any other data storage medium. The memory may include data, programs, and/or instructions and any other software or firmware executable by the processor. Control logic can be implemented in hardware or in software, such as a firmware stored in the memory.</div>
    <div id="p-0435" num="0434" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The XWEAR device <b class="style-scope patent-text">50</b> is electrically powered by a power source <b class="style-scope patent-text">51</b> that may be a primary or rechargeable battery, or may comprise a power supply that may contain a DC/DC converter or AC/DC converter. The power supply may be an AC/DC power supply that is power fed from the AC power supply via AC plug and a cord, and thus may include an AC/DC converter, for converting the AC power (commonly 115 VAC/60 Hz or 220 VAC/50 Hz) into the required DC voltage or voltages. Such power supplies are known in the art and typically involves converting 120 or 240 volt AC supplied by a power utility company to a well-regulated lower voltage DC for electronic devices. In one embodiment, the power supply is integrated into a single device or circuit, in order to share common circuits. Further, the power supply may include a boost converter, such as a buck boost converter, charge pump, inverter and regulators as known in the art, as required for conversion of one form of electrical power to another desired form and voltage. While the power supply (either separated or integrated) can be an integral part and housed within the XWEAR <b class="style-scope patent-text">50</b> enclosure, it may be enclosed as a separate housing connected via cable to the XWEAR device <b class="style-scope patent-text">50</b> assembly. For example, a small outlet plug-in step-down transformer shape can be used (also known as wall-wart, “power brick”, “plug pack”, “plug-in adapter”, “adapter block”, “domestic mains adapter”, “power adapter”, or AC adapter). Further, the power supply may be a linear or switching type.</div>
    <div id="p-0436" num="0435" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Alternatively or in addition, the power source <b class="style-scope patent-text">51</b> may comprise a primary battery or cell, in which an irreversible chemical reaction generates the electricity, and thus the cell is disposable and cannot be recharged, and need to be replaced after the battery is drained. Such battery replacement may be expensive and cumbersome. Alternatively or in addition, a rechargeable (secondary) battery may be used, such as a nickel-cadmium based battery. In such a case, a battery charger is employed for charging the battery while it is in use or not in use. Various types of such battery chargers are known in the art, such as trickle chargers, pulse chargers and the like. The battery charger may be integrated with the field unit or be external to it. The battery may be a primary or a rechargeable (secondary) type, may include a single or few batteries, and may use various chemicals for the electro-chemical cells, such as lithium, alkaline and nickel-cadmium. Common batteries are manufactured in pre-defined standard output voltages (1.5, 3, 4.5, 9 Volts, for example), as well as defined standard mechanical enclosures (usually defined by letters such as “A”, “AA”, “B”, “C” sizes), and ‘coin’ type. In one embodiment, the battery (or batteries) is held in a battery holder or compartment, and thus can be easily replaced.</div>

An audio signal is applied to the crystal, which responds by flexing in proportion to the voltage applied across the crystal surfaces, thus converting electrical energy into mechanical. Piezoelectric speakers are frequently used as beepers in watches and other electronic devices, and are sometimes used as tweeters in less-expensive speaker systems, such as computer speakers and portable radios. A loudspeaker may be a magnetostrictive transducers, based on magnetostriction, have been predominantly used as sonar ultrasonic sound wave radiators, but their usage has spread also to audio speaker systems.</div>
    <div id="p-0449" num="0448" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">A loudspeaker may be an electrostatic loudspeaker (ESL), in which sound is generated by the force exerted on a membrane suspended in an electrostatic field. Such speakers use a thin flat diaphragm usually consisting of a plastic sheet coated with a conductive material such as graphite sandwiched between two electrically conductive grids, with a small air gap between the diaphragm and grids. The diaphragm is usually made from a polyester film (thickness 2-20 μm) with exceptional mechanical properties, such as PET film. By means of the conductive coating and an external high voltage supply, the diaphragm is held at a DC potential of several kilovolts with respect to the grids. The grids are driven by the audio signal; and the front and rear grids are driven in antiphase. As a result a uniform electrostatic field proportional to the audio signal is produced between both grids. This causes a force to be exerted on the charged diaphragm, and its resulting movement drives the air on either side of it.</div>
    <div id="p-0450" num="0449" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">A loudspeaker may be a magnetic loudspeaker, and may be a ribbon or planar type, is based on a magnetic field. A ribbon speaker consists of a thin metal-film ribbon suspended in a magnetic field. The electrical signal is applied to the ribbon, which moves with it to create the sound. Planar magnetic speakers are speakers with roughly rectangular flat surfaces that radiate in a bipolar (i.e., front and back) manner, and may be having printed or embedded conductors on a flat diaphragm. Planar magnetic speakers consist of a flexible membrane with a voice coil printed or mounted on it. The current flowing through the coil interacts with the magnetic field of carefully placed magnets on either side of the diaphragm, causing the membrane to vibrate more uniformly and without much bending or wrinkling. A loudspeaker may be a bending wave loudspeaker, which uses a diaphragm that is intentionally flexible.</div>
    <div id="p-0451" num="0450" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">A sounder may an electromechanical type, such as an electric bell, which may be based on an electromagnet, causing a metal ball to clap on cup or half-sphere bell. A sounder may be a buzzer (or beeper), a chime, a whistle or a ringer. Buzzers may be either electromechanical or ceramic-based piezoelectric sounders that make a high-pitch noise, and may be used for alerting. The sounder may emit a single or multiple tones, and can be in continuous or intermittent operation.</div>
    <div id="p-0452" num="0451" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In one example, the sounder is used to play a stored digital audio. The digital audio content can be stored in the sounder, the actuator unit, the router, the control server, or any combination thereof. Further, few files may be stored (e.g., representing different announcements or songs), selected by the control logic. Alternatively or in addition, the digital audio data may be received by the sounder, the actuator unit, the router, the control server, or any combination thereof, from external sources via the above networks. Furthermore, the source of the digital audio may a microphone serving as a sensor, either after processing, storing, delaying, or any other manipulation, or as originally received resulting ‘doorphone’ or ‘intercom’ functionality between a microphone and a sounder in the building.</div>
    <div id="p-0453" num="0452" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In another example, the sounder simulates the voice of a human being or generates music, typically by using an electronic circuit having a memory for storing the sounds (e.g., music, song, voice message, etc.), a digital to analog converter to reconstruct the electrical representation of the sound, and a driver for driving a loudspeaker, which is an electro-acoustic transducer that converts an electrical signal to sound. An example of a greeting card providing music and mechanical movement is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application No. 2007/0256337 to Segan entitled: “User Interactive Greeting Card”, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</div>
    <div id="p-0454" num="0453" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In one example, the system is used for sound or music generation. For example, the sound produced can emulate the sounds of a conventional acoustical music instrument, such as a piano, tuba, harp, violin, flute, guitar and so forth. In one example, the sounder is an audible signaling device, emitting audible sounds that can be heard (having frequency components in the 20-20,000 Hz band). In one example the sound generated is music or song. The elements of the music such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics, and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture, may be associated with the shape theme. For example, if a musical instrument shown in the picture, the music generated by that instrument will be played, e.g., drumming sound of drums and playing of a flute or guitar. In one example, a talking human voice is played by the sounder. The sound may be a syllable, a word, a phrase, a sentence, a short story or a long story, and can be based on speech synthesis or pre-recorded. Male or female voice can be used, further being young or old.</div>

    <div id="p-0456" num="0455" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">A speech synthesizer used to produce natural and intelligible artificial human speech may be implemented in hardware, in software, or combination thereof. A speech synthesizer may be Text-To-Speech (TTS) based, that converts normal language text to speech, or alternatively (or in addition) may be based on rendering symbolic linguistic representation like phonetic transcription. A TTS typically involves two steps, the front-end where the raw input text is pre-processed to fully write-out words replacing numbers and abbreviations, followed by assigning phonetic transcriptions to each word (text-to-phoneme), and the back-end (or synthesizer) where the symbolic linguistic representation is converted to output sound.</div>
    <div id="p-0457" num="0456" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The generating of synthetic speech waveform typically uses a concatenative or formant synthesis. The concatenative synthesis commonly produces the most natural-sounding synthesized speech, and is based on the concatenation (or stringing together) of segments of recorded speech. There are three main types of concatenative synthesis: Unit selection, diphone synthesis, and domain-specific synthesis. Unit selection synthesis is based on large databases of recorded speech including individual phones, diphones, half-phones, syllables, morphemes, words, phrases, and sentences, indexed based on the segmentation and acoustic parameters like the fundamental frequency (pitch), duration, position in the syllable, and neighboring phones. At run time, the desired target utterance is created by determining (typically using a specially weighted decision tree) the best chain of candidate units from the database (unit selection). Diphone synthesis uses a minimal speech database containing all the diphones (sound-to-sound transitions) occurring in a language, and at runtime, the target prosody of a sentence is superimposed on these minimal units by means of digital signal processing techniques such as linear predictive coding. Domain-specific synthesis is used where the output is limited to a particular domain, using concatenates prerecorded words and phrases to create complete utterances. In formant synthesis the synthesized speech output is created using additive synthesis and an acoustic model (physical modeling synthesis), rather than on using human speech samples. Parameters (or features) such as fundamental frequency, voicing, and noise levels are varied over time to create a waveform of artificial speech. The synthesis may further be based on articulatory synthesis where computational techniques for synthesizing speech are based on models of the human vocal tract and the articulation processes occurring there, or may be HMM-based synthesis which is based on hidden Markov models, where the frequency spectrum (vocal tract), fundamental frequency (vocal source), and duration (prosody) of speech are modeled simultaneously by HMMs and generated based on the maximum likelihood criterion. The speech synthesizer may further be based on the book entitled: “<i class="style-scope patent-text">Development in Speech Synthesis</i>”, by Mark Tatham and Katherine Morton, published 2005 by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd., ISBN: 0-470-85538-X, and on the book entitled: “Speech Synthesis and Recognition” by John Holmes and Wendy Holmes, 2<sup class="style-scope patent-text">nd </sup>Edition, published 2001 ISBN: 0-7484-0856-8, which are both incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</div>

Similarly, Microsoft uses SAPI 4.0 and SAPI 5.0 as part of Windows operating system. Similarly, hardware may be used, and may be based on an IC. A tone, voice, melody, or song hardware-based sounder typically contains a memory storing a digital representation of the pre-recorder or synthesized voice or music, a Digital to Analog (D/A) converter for creating an analog signal, a speaker and a driver for feeding the speaker.

A dynamic microphone is commonly based on electromagnetic induction, using a diaphragm attached to a small movable induction coil that is positioned in a magnetic field of a permanent magnet. The incident sound waves cause the diaphragm to vibrate, and the coil to move in the magnetic field, producing a current. Similarly, a ribbon microphone uses a thin, usually corrugated metal ribbon suspended in a magnetic field, and its vibration within the magnetic field generates the electrical signal. A loudspeaker is commonly constructed similar to a dynamic microphone, and thus may be used as a microphone as well. In a carbon microphone, the diaphragm vibrations apply varying pressure to a carbon, thus changing its electrical resistance. A piezoelectric microphone (a.k.a. crystal or piezo microphone) is based on the phenomenon of piezoelectricity in piezoelectric crystals such as potassium sodium tartrate.

Alternatively or in addition, in the case where the comparison is based on comparing signal strength (such as RSSI), the difference between the signal strength may be used as aligning criterion, where the lines are determined as aligned when the difference is lower than a pre-set threshold value. For example, the pre-set threshold may be equal to, higher than, or lower than, 1 dB, 2 dB, 3 dB, 5 dB, 7 dB, 10 dB, 15 dB, 20 dB, 25 dB, 30 dB, 35 dB, or 40 dB.

The signal strength was measured using an RF signal meter model ED88T from Cornet® Micro systems Inc., Corresponding to Table 1 above, a distance of about 40 cm to the digital camera <b class="style-scope patent-text">45</b> from the antenna <b class="style-scope patent-text">47</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">b </i>(in centimeter), and an angle α <b class="style-scope patent-text">49</b> around 45°, and at a the plane of the antennas around the head, a signal level of 0.2 (data in mW/m<sup class="style-scope patent-text">2</sup>) was received from the antenna <b class="style-scope patent-text">47</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">b</i>, a level of 0.07 was received from the antenna <b class="style-scope patent-text">47</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">e</i>, a level of 0.035 was received from the antenna <b class="style-scope patent-text">47</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">c</i>, a level of 0.01 was received from the antenna <b class="style-scope patent-text">47</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">d</i>, and a level of 0.01 was received from the antenna <b class="style-scope patent-text">47</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a</i>.

This noise or reflection should to be taken into account. In one example, we can assume the noise is 0.01 (signal traveling 17 cm inside water/head will degrade to practically 0.01% in 2.4 GHz), and subtract that from all readings. Using these tables with and similar tables with multiple antennas (connected or part of transceiver or receiver), a better estimation of distance, direction, or location may be obtained by using a best fit method, thus eliminating the inaccuracies and noises associated with the various (like RSSI) measurements.</div>

In order to avoid such scenario, a timer is used for measuring the time period associated with the ‘aligned’ state before taking any action in response to that state. The timing of the ‘aligned’ status is measured by a timer as part of a “Time Elapsed?” step <b class="style-scope patent-text">75</b>, and is compared to a time interval threshold. The action taken in the “Take Picture” step <b class="style-scope patent-text">79</b> is performed only in case the ‘aligned’ state exists more than the time interval threshold value. If the system moves to ‘non-alignment’ state before the time interval timer expires, then non-action is taken and the user is notified as part of the “Notify User” step <b class="style-scope patent-text">76</b>.</div>

The AC power typically consists of a sine wave (or sinusoid) waveform, where the voltage relates to an RMS amplitude value (120 or 230), and having a frequency measured in Hertz, relating to the number of cycles (or oscillations) per second. Commonly single-phase infrastructure exists, and a wiring in the building commonly uses three wires, known as a line wire (also known as phase, hot, or active) that carry the alternating current, a neutral wire (also known as zero or return) which completes the electrical circuit by providing a return current path, and an earth or ground wire, typically connected to the chassis of any AC-powered equipment that serves as a safety means against electric shocks.</div>

Home appliances are electrical and mechanical devices using technology for household use, such as food handling, cleaning, clothes handling, or environmental control. Appliances are commonly used in household, institutional, commercial or industrial setting, for accomplishing routine housekeeping tasks, and are typically electrically powered. The appliance may be a major appliance, also known as “White Goods”, which is commonly large, difficult to move, and generally to some extent fixed in place (usually on the floor or mounted on a wall or ceiling), and is electrically powered from the AC power (mains) grid. Non-limiting examples of major appliances are washing machines, clothes dryers, dehumidifiers, conventional ovens, stoves, refrigerators, freezers, air-conditioners, trash compactors, furnaces, dishwasher, water heaters, microwave ovens and induction cookers. The appliance may be a small appliance, also known as “Brown Goods”, which is commonly a small home appliance that is portable or semi-portable, and is typically a tabletop or a coutertop type. Examples of small appliances are television sets, CD and DVD players, HiFi and home cinema systems, telephone sets and answering machines, and beverage making devices such as coffee-makers and iced-tea makers.</div>

Other appliances main function is food preparation, such as conventional ovens (stoves) or microwave ovens, electric mixers, food processors, and electric food blenders, as well as beverage makers such as coffee-makers and iced-tea makers. Clothes cleaning appliances examples are washing/laundry machines and clothes dryers. A vacuum cleaner is an appliance used to suck up dust and dirt, usually from floors and other surfaces. Some appliances main function relates to temperature control, such as heating and cooling.

The switch may be a ‘normally open’ type, requiring actuation for closing the contacts, may be ‘normally closed’ type, where actuation affects breaking the circuit, or may be a changeover switch, having both types of contacts arrangements. A changeover switch may be either a ‘make-before-break’ or a ‘break-before-make’ type. The switch contacts may have one or more poles and one or more throws. Common switch contacts arrangements include Single-Pole-Single-Throw (SPST), Single-Pole-Double-Throw (SPDT), Double-Pole-Double-Throw (DPDT), Double-Pole-Single-Throw (DPST), and Single-Pole-Changeover (SPCO). A switch may be electrically or mechanically actuated.</div>
    <div id="p-0511" num="0510" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">A relay is a non-limiting example of an electrically operated switch. A relay may be a latching relay, that has two relaxed states (bi-stable), and when the current is switched off, the relay remains in its last state. This is achieved with a solenoid operating a ratchet and cam mechanism, or by having two opposing coils with an over-center spring or permanent magnet to hold the armature and contacts in position while the coil is relaxed, or with a permanent core. A relay may be an electromagnetic relay, that typically consists of a coil of wire wrapped around a soft iron core, an iron yoke which provides a low reluctance path for magnetic flux, a movable iron armature, and one or more sets of contacts. The armature is hinged to the yoke and mechanically linked to one or more sets of moving contacts. It is held in place by a spring so that when the relay is de-energized there is an air gap in the magnetic circuit. In this condition, one of the two sets of contacts in the relay pictured is closed, and the other set is open. A reed relay is a reed switch enclosed in a solenoid, and the switch has a set of contacts inside an evacuated or inert gas-filled glass tube, which protects the contacts against atmospheric corrosion.</div>

In one example, the SSR may be controlled by an optocoupler, such as a CPC1965Y AC Solid State Relay, available from IXYS Integrated Circuits Division (Headquartered in Milpitas, Calif., U.S.A.) which is an AC Solid State Relay (SSR) using waveguide coupling with dual power SCR outputs to produce an alternative to optocoupler and Triac circuits. The switches are robust enough to provide a blocking voltage of up to 600VP, and are tightly controlled zero-cross circuitry ensures switching of AC loads without the generation of transients. The input and output circuits are optically coupled to provide 3750Vrms of isolation and noise immunity between control and load circuits.

Further, a thyristor such as a Triode for Alternating Current (TRIAC) may be used for triggering the power.

The transistor may be a Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET, MOS-FET, or MOS FET), commonly used for amplifying or switching electronic signals. The MOSFET transistor is a four-terminal component with source (S), gate (G), drain (D), and body (B) terminals, where the body (or substrate) of the MOSFET is often connected to the source terminal, making it a three-terminal component like other field-effect transistors. In an enhancement mode MOSFETs, a voltage drop across the oxide induces a conducting channel between the source and drain contacts via the field effect. The term “enhancement mode” refers to the increase of conductivity with an increase in oxide field that adds carriers to the channel, also referred to as the inversion layer. The channel can contain electrons (called an nMOSFET or nMOS), or holes (called a pMOSFET or pMOS), opposite in type to the substrate, so nMOS is made with a p-type substrate, and pMOS with an n-type substrate. In one example, a switch may be based on an N-channel enhancement mode standard level field-effect transistor that features very low on-state resistance. Such a transistor may be based on, or consists of, TrenchMOS transistor Part Number BUK7524-55 from Philips Semiconductors, described in the Product Specifications from Philips Semiconductors “<i class="style-scope patent-text">TrenchMOS™ transistor Standard level FET BUK</i>7524-55” Rev 1.000 dated January 1997, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</div>

    <div id="p-0519" num="0518" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The system and method exampled above involved controlling a device based on an alignment between a person line of sight (estimated by the head pose) and the direction of the person head to the device, and the device was exampled to be a digital camera (such as in the flow chart <b class="style-scope patent-text">70</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS" class="style-scope patent-text">FIG. 7</figref>) or a general apparatus (as described in the flow chart <b class="style-scope patent-text">70</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS" class="style-scope patent-text">FIG. 7<i class="style-scope patent-text">a</i> </figref>). Hence, the device may be controlled in response to the person looking at it. Alternatively or in addition, the alignment estimating may be used for detecting and alerting when the person is not looking at the device. For example, a vehicle driver EOR (Eyes-Off-the-Road) state may be detected, by the driver wearing the LWEAR device <b class="style-scope patent-text">50</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a </i>and RWEAR device <b class="style-scope patent-text">50</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">b </i>(or the combined RLWEAR device <b class="style-scope patent-text">50</b>″), and the antenna <b class="style-scope patent-text">53</b> (such as of the improved camera device <b class="style-scope patent-text">45</b> or of any other controlled device) may be located along the required person line-of-sight, such as in front of a vehicle the driver is operating. In such a scheme, the system may be used to estimate the driver head pose relative to the front road view, and may alert the driver if the head pose is not directed as required for a pre-set time interval. In such a case, the apparatus <b class="style-scope patent-text">81</b> that is a part of the controlled device <b class="style-scope patent-text">80</b> may include, or may be substituted by, a user notifier <b class="style-scope patent-text">58</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a</i>, that may be identical or similar to the user notifier <b class="style-scope patent-text">58</b>, used for alerting the driver is case of EOR state, as exampled by a controlled device <b class="style-scope patent-text">120</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS" class="style-scope patent-text">FIG. 12</figref>.

Similar to the flow chart <b class="style-scope patent-text">70</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS" class="style-scope patent-text">FIG. 7</figref>, the head pose direction relative to the direction to the device <b class="style-scope patent-text">120</b> is estimated as part of the “Estimate Relative Gaze” step <b class="style-scope patent-text">73</b>, and the estimated relative angle may be considered as aligned by applying a criterion (such as a threshold) as part of the “Aligned?” step <b class="style-scope patent-text">74</b>. In the case of alignment according to the pre-set criterion, then proper operation is assumed, such as the driver is indeed looking at the road and no EOR state is present, and the system may rest, or may resume operation immediately or after a set time interval as part of the “Wait” step <b class="style-scope patent-text">69</b>.</div>
    <div id="p-0521" num="0520" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">As long as the driver EOR state is brief, this may be part of normal and safe vehicle driving, and no action needs to be taken. However, a long EOR state affect the driving safety. Thus, as part of the “Time Elapsed?” step <b class="style-scope patent-text">75</b> the duration of the EOR state is measured versus a timing criterion. In a case where the EOR state is too long and exceeds the pre-set criterion, such as being in the EOR state more than 3 seconds, the driver is notified as part of a “Notify User” step <b class="style-scope patent-text">76</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a</i>, that may be identical or similar to the “Notify User” step <b class="style-scope patent-text">76</b> in the flow chart <b class="style-scope patent-text">70</b>.

As part of the “Notify User” step <b class="style-scope patent-text">76</b> <i class="style-scope patent-text">a</i>, output may be provided to other systems or apparatuses, such as to systems that control a vehicle speed or direction. For example, the output may be used to re-direct the vehicle to a correct lane when departing from one, in case the driver is detected as not looking ahead. The vehicle systems may include motion detection such as driver assistance systems that may be similar to Mobileye system available from Mobileye headquartered in the Netherlands and having R&amp;D center in Jerusalem, Israel.</div>

    <div id="p-0550" num="0549" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The action taken may include activation of an annunciator that may consist of one or more visual or audible signaling component, or any other devices that indicate a status to the person. The annunciator may include a visual signaling device. For example, the annunciator may be activated when the estimated value of the angle α <b class="style-scope patent-text">49</b> exceeds a threshold that is either a minimum or a maximum one. Alternatively or in addition, the annunciator parameters may be controlled based on the estimated value. In one example, the device illuminates a visible light, such as a Light-Emitting-Diode (LED), or uses a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) that uses changes in the reflectivity in an applied electric field. The LED may be a multi-color LED, such as LED Part No. 08L5015RGBC available from RSR Electronics, Inc. from NJ, U.S.A., described in Data-sheet Multi Color LED Part No. 08L5015RGBC, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. However, any type of visible electric light emitter such as a flashlight, an incandescent lamp, and compact fluorescent lamps can be used. Multiple light emitters may be used, and the illumination may be steady, blinking or flashing. Further, a single-state visual indicator may be used to provide multiple indications, such as by using different colors (of the same visual indicator), different intensity levels, variable duty-cycle and so forth. Such conceptual relationships may include, for example, the light emitters' brightness, appearance, location, type, color and steadiness that are influenced by the estimated value. In one example, the annunciator operation is based on a numerical digital display that provides readings in the form of numbers of the estimated value of any value derived thereof. For example, the annunciator may use the quadruple digits, seven-segments, LED display Part No.: LTC-3610G available from Lite-On Electronics, Inc., and described in Lite-On Electronics, Inc., Publication BNS-OD-C131/A4 downloaded March 2011, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. Similarly, the annunciator may be based on an alphanumerical digital display that provides readings in the form of characters, including numbers, letters or symbols.

    <div id="p-0551" num="0550" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Any apparatus herein may be used to display word messages in a variety of fashions and formats, such as scrolling, static, bold and flashing. The device may further display visual display material beyond words and characters, such as arrows, symbols, ASCII and non-ASCII characters, still images such as pictures and video. The annunciator may use any electronic display or any other output device used for the presentation of visual information. The display may be a digital or analog video display, and may use technologies such as LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), TFT (Thin-Film Transistor), FED (Field Emission Display), CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) or any other electronic screen technology that visually shows information such as graphics or text. In many cases, an adaptor (not shown) is required in order to connect an analog display to the digital data. For example, the adaptor may convert to composite video (PAL, NTSC) or S-Video or HDTV signal. Analog displays commonly use interfaces such as composite video such as NTSC, PAL or SECAM formats. Similarly, analog RGB, VGA (Video Graphics Array), SVGA (Super Video Graphics Array), SCART, S-video and other standard analog interfaces can be used. Further, personal computer monitors, plasma or flat panel displays, CRT, DLP display or a video projector may be equally used. Standard digital interfaces such as an IEEE1394 interface, also known as FireWire™, may be used. Other digital interfaces that can be used are USB, SDI (Serial Digital Interface), FireWire, HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface), DVI (Digital Visual Interface), UDI (Unified Display Interface), DisplayPort, Digital Component Video and DVB (Digital Video Broadcast).</div>
    <div id="p-0552" num="0551" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In one example, the annunciator affects sound or music generation. The estimated value may be associated with a musical tune (or a tone) or any other single sound, which is played upon activation of the annunciator. The annunciator may include an audible signaling device (sounder) that emits audible sounds that can be heard by a human (having frequency components in the 20-20,000 Hz band). In one example, the device is a buzzer (or beeper), a chime, a whistle or a ringer. Buzzers are known in the art and are either electromechanical or ceramic-based piezoelectric sounders that make a high-pitch noise. The sounder may emit a single or multiple tones, and can be in continuous or intermittent operation. In another example, the sounder simulates the voice of a human being or generates music, typically by using an electronic circuit having a memory for storing the sounds (e.g., click, gong, music, song, voice message, etc.), a digital to analog converter to reconstruct the electrical representation of the sound and driver for driving a loudspeaker, which is an electro-acoustical transducer that converts an electrical signal to sound. An example of a greeting card providing music and mechanical movement is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application 2007/0256337 to Segan entitled: “User Interactive Greeting Card”, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.

    <div id="p-0553" num="0552" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In one example, a human voice talking is played by the annunciator. The sound may be a syllable, a word, a phrase, a sentence, a short story or a long story, and can be based on speech synthesis or pre-recorded. Male or female voice can be used, being young or old. The text sounded is preferably associated with the shape or theme. For example, an estimated value or a quality-associated value derived thereof of the system can be heard, such as ‘good’, ‘not in field’ and ‘low quality’.</div>
    <div id="p-0554" num="0553" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">A tone, voice, melody or song sounder typically contains a memory storing a digital representation of the pre-recorder or synthesized voice or music, a digital to analog (D/A) converter for creating an analog signal, a speaker and a driver for feeding the speaker.
