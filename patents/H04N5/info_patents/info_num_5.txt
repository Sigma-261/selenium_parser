The camera 300, the light sensor 500, and the receiver 400 are integrated in the input/output module 600, and the input/output module 600 further includes a base 700 and a circuit board 800.
The base 700 may be configured to receive the camera 300, the light sensor 500, and the receiver 400, in detail, the base 700 includes a light transmissive region corresponding to the camera 300 and the light sensor 500 so that light enters the base 700 from the light transmissive region and is received by the camera 300 and the light sensor 500. The base 700 includes a sound region corresponding to the receiver 400 so that sound of the receiver 400 can be transmitted from the sound region.
The camera 300, the light sensor 500, and the receiver 400 are located on the circuit board 800. In detail, the circuit board 800 includes a hard board (not shown) and a flexible board 80 accommodated in the base 700, the camera 300, the light sensor 500, and the receiver 400 are located on the hard board, and the flexible board 80 extends to the outside of the base 700.
When the input/output module 600 is mounted on the electronic device 1000, the circuit board 800 can be connected to a main board of the electronic device 1000 to realize information exchange between the input/output module 600 and the mainboard of the electronic device 1000. The mounting position of the input/output module 600 may correspond to the first slot 103.
In detail, the input/output module 600 may include one camera 300 or two cameras 300, and the detail arrangement between the camera 300, the light sensor 500, and the receiver 400 may be approximately the same as any one of those disclosed in the above embodiments, and is not described here.
FIGS. 75 to 78 illustrate that, in an embodiment, a projection profile of the sound outlet 40 is approximately the same as a projection profile of the inner wall of the display panel 10 surrounding the at least one hole 1034 in a direction perpendicular to the cover plate 14. In detail, in a projection perpendicular to the cover plate 14, a projection profile of the sound outlet 40 adjacent to the inner wall of the display panel 10 surrounding the at least one hole 1034 or a portion of the projection profile of the sound outlet 40 substantially coincides with the projection profile of the inner wall of the display panel 10 surrounding the at least one hole 1034. In other words, a portion of the projection profile of the sound outlet 40 is arranged at the edge of the at least one hole 1034. The camera 300 and the light sensor 500 are located above the sound output 40. FIGS. 75 to 76 illustrate that, in an embodiment, the sound outlet 40 is arranged within the at least a hole 1034. FIGS. 77 to 78 illustrate that, in another embodiment, the sound outlet 40 is arranged outside the at least a hole 1034. In some embodiments, the sound outlet 40 is an annular structure. A number of the at least one camera is two.
In an embodiment, the display panel 10 includes at least a void extending through the display surface 101 and the back surface 102. The at least a void is located in the display area 11 and is configured for exposure of at least one component of the electronic device 1000. The display area 11, except the at least a void, includes a plurality of image pixels. The void can be a slot. The at least a void can be at least a notch recessed from an edge of the display panel 10. Or, the at least a void can be at least a hole defined in the display panel 10.
In an embodiment, the at least one component of the electronic device 1000 is selected from the group including the at least one camera, a receiver, a light sensor, a projector, a microphone, a speaker, a distance sensor, an illuminator, and a combination thereof. A number of the at least one camera is two. In another embodiment, the at least one camera includes two front cameras. One of the two front cameras is an infrared camera. The infrared camera includes an image sensor and an infrared filter. The light sensor is an ambient light sensor. The projector is a dot projector including a laser such as a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL). The distance sensor is a proximity sensor. The illuminator is a flood illuminator including a laser such as a VCSEL.
In detail, the proximity sensor and the ambient light sensor help the at least one camera determine how much illumination is needed for recognition of a face. The flood illuminator produces infrared (IR) light, part of electromagnetic spectrum invisible to an eye of the face, to illuminate the face. The dot projector produces more than 30,000 dots of invisible IR light to create a three-dimensional map (for area and depth) of a facial landscape of the face. The infrared camera captures images of dot patterns and IR light reflected from the face. Therefore, the infrared camera uses IR light to establish presence of the face.
